/**
 * Shipped-locale product changelog for PI-Desktop app releases.
 *
 * English is the source of truth (ADR 0009). The translated catalogs mirror
 * the same versions and bullet counts so in-app "what's new" can follow the
 * active UI locale without a network fetch or renderer-supplied feed URL.
 *
 * Update this file before cutting a release tag. GitHub release bodies may
 * still be auto-generated for the web; they are not the in-app source.
 * Stable product versions only — omit pre-releases.
