# 06. Host RPC Protocol

## 1. Goal

Define the local protocol between:

- Electron main (orchestrator)
- Rust host-core (privileged backend)
- Node pi agent sidecar (tool requester / event source consumer via host)

MVP transport decision (**D001**):

> **stdio JSON-RPC over NDJSON**

## 2. Transport

- Process: Electron main spawns Rust host-core sidecar
- Channel: child process stdin/stdout
- Framing: one JSON object per line (NDJSON)
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Request/response: JSON-RPC 2.0 style

The control pipe is resource-isolated inside host-core. One dedicated OS
thread reads stdin and one dedicated OS thread serializes stdout; request and
tool tasks never perform Tokio stdio operations. This keeps temporary OS
thread exhaustion from turning a pipe read/write into a Tokio blocking-pool
panic. The threads retry interrupted and transient nonblocking errors while
preserving one-message-per-line framing; an unrecoverable pipe error ends the
host and is handled by the normal Electron supervision path.

### 2.1 Runtime admission and backpressure

Host-core does not create an unbounded task or subprocess for every request.
The RPC dispatcher caps active requests at 32. `tools.execute` then enters a
bounded execution budget:

- 16 total tool executions
- 4 concurrent `Bash` processes globally, 2 per session
- 8 read/search tools globally
- 2 mutating tools globally, 1 per session
- 4 plugin tools globally
- 4 tool executions per session
- 64 queued tool executions globally

Permission prompts do not consume an execution slot. A full queue returns
`HOST_OVERLOADED` with retryable semantics in the tool result instead of
waiting indefinitely or spawning more work. The limits are host-owned so
Electron and the sidecar cannot independently over-admit the same resources.
The per-session mutation permit is acquired before the global mutation slot;
queued `Write`/`Edit` calls therefore do not hold global capacity while waiting
for an earlier mutation in the same session.

Electron's `HostProcess` treats an explicit `HOST_OVERLOADED` response as
retryable backpressure for renderer-facing calls. It waits 50, 100, 200, and
400 ms between at most four retries, then returns the structured error to the
caller. This retry applies only to an admission rejection; transport failure,
timeout, and errors from an admitted request are never replayed.

### Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req_01H...",
  "method": "tools.execute",
  "params": {}
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req_01H...",
  "result": {}
}
```

### Error

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req_01H...",
  "error": {
    "code": 1003,
    "message": "PATH_OUTSIDE_WORKSPACE",
    "data": {
      "errorCode": "PATH_OUTSIDE_WORKSPACE",
      "details": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Notification (server → client, no id)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "permissions.request",
  "params": {}
}
```

## 3. Handshake

On spawn, Electron must call:

### `app.handshake`

Params:

```ts
type HandshakeParams = {
  protocolVersion: 11
  client: "electron-main"
  clientVersion: string
  locale: string // default "en"
}
```

Result:

```ts
type HandshakeResult = {
  protocolVersion: 11
  host: "rust-host-core"
  hostVersion: string
  features: string[]
  capabilities: string[] // does not include "a2a"
}
```

Rules:

1. If protocol major version mismatches → abort boot
2. Electron should exit with actionable error if handshake fails
3. All subsequent calls require successful handshake
4. Version 4 introduced the durable notification inbox and the
   notification-bearing `session.endTurn` result.
5. Version 5 requires the host-owned `session.fork` snapshot operation; a
   version 4 host must be rejected before chat becomes interactive (ADR 0023).
6. Version 6 adds durable model-context checkpoints through
   `session.appendCompaction`; a version 5 host must be rejected before the
   runtime claims automatic context protection (ADR 0030).
7. Version 9 is the frozen ADR 0053/0054 contract: it covers the checkpoint
   Plan artifact/queue, active-turn Plan identity/CAS, explicit approval
   permission, shell catalog identity and dialect pin, streamed command output,
   and scheduled-task mode projection from `config_json`. A v7 or incompatible
   v8 host must be rejected before the UI becomes interactive.
8. Version 10 added the A2A protocol stack (ADR 0147): the host-core A2A broker,
   the `a2a.*` method domain, and the `a2a.task.event` / `a2a.push` host→client
   notifications. The `capabilities` array advertised `"a2a"`; a v9 host that
   could not advertise `a2a` was rejected before the UI became interactive.
9. Version 11 withdraws that stack (ADR 0165 / D326). The `a2a.*` methods and
   `a2a.task.event` / `a2a.push` notifications are gone. Handshake no longer
   advertises `"a2a"`. A v10 host or client is rejected before the UI becomes
   interactive, so a mixed pair cannot call a missing domain.

Protocol v11 is paired with host-core storage schema v16. Schema v12 had added
the A2A tables (`a2a_tasks`, `a2a_messages`, `a2a_artifacts`,
`a2a_push_configs`) via `migrate_v11_to_v12`; `migrate_v12_to_v13` drops those
tables, and v14 adds the plugin-session ownership sidecar and soft-delete
column. Schema v15 adds the Host-owned turn queue, and schema v16 adds the
session collaboration ledger and its turn-queue binding. A fresh database
creates neither A2A tables nor unowned plugin-session rows. The schema version is an
internal persistence invariant, not an additional JSON-RPC field; the
checkpoint architecture remains host-owned.

## 4. Method catalog (MVP)

### App
- `app.handshake`
- `app.health`
- `app.getVersion`
- `app.getOnboarding` — inline onboarding checklist state (D031)

`app.health` returns a diagnostic `toolBudget` object:

```ts
type ToolBudgetHealth = {
  active: number
  queued: number
  total: number
  shell: number
  reads: number
  mutations: number
  plugins: number
}
```

### Workspace
- `workspace.get`
- `workspace.set`
- `workspace.clear`

### Review snapshots (ADR 0043)
- `review.rollback({sessionId, snapshotId})` — verify the current post-tool
  hash, restore the session-owned previous bytes, and return one of
  `rolledBack`, `alreadyRolledBack`, `conflict`, or `unavailable`.

### Projects
- `projects.list` — returns durable project records ordered pinned-first, then
  by last-opened time; includes records materialized by session imports
- `projects.create({ path })` — upserts a durable project record without
  changing the active workspace and returns the host-generated project id
- `projects.remove({ path })` — deletes one durable project row together with
  every session attached to it, removing those sessions' transcript, scratch,
  and review files and the project's durable memory, and never touching the
  project folder on disk. Idempotent: an unknown path returns
  `{ removed: false, sessionsRemoved: 0 }`. A path that is a root of a stored
  multi-folder project group is refused so the group keeps a valid primary root,
  and the call is refused (1008 / `CONFLICT`) while any attached session has a
  running turn, so a live turn never loses the transcript it is writing.
- `project.memory.get({ path })` — returns the durable memory for the canonical
  project path, or an empty record when no memory has been saved
- `project.memory.set({ path, entries })` — normalizes and stores visual memory
  entries, derives readable `content`, and validates the 32 KiB limit. The
  derived value is injected into that project's next runtime context as
  user-provided context. `{ path, content }` remains supported for legacy
  callers and returns a memory record without structured entries.
- `project.groups.list` — returns one host-owned logical group per named
  project. Existing path-only records are compatibility `legacy` groups.
- `project.group.create({ name, folders })` — validates the display name and
  local directories, stores the ordered roots, and returns the new group
  without changing the active workspace. A non-legacy root cannot belong to a
  second group.
- `project.group.rename({ groupId, name })` — persists the group display name.
- `project.group.update({ groupId, name, folders })` — edits the group name and
  ordered roots. The primary root must remain first; duplicate roots are
  removed, roots owned by another non-legacy group are rejected, and a root
  with existing chats cannot be detached. Removed roots are retained as
  suppressed historical paths rather than reappearing as standalone legacy
  groups.
- `project.group.memory.get/set({ groupId, entries })` — reads or normalizes
  shared group memory using the existing 32 KiB entry limit.
- `project.group.instructions.get/set({ groupId, content })` — reads or stores
  shared group instructions using a bounded host-owned value.
- `project.group.context({ path })` — resolves the group containing a primary or
  member root and returns its shared instructions and memory for runtime launch.
  Legacy groups return no group context so the path-scoped compatibility APIs
  remain authoritative. Builtin tools default to the primary root; absolute
  paths under registered additional roots use the same canonical containment
  resolver and never become arbitrary external access.

### Secrets
- `secrets.set`
- `secrets.delete`
- `secrets.has`
- `secrets.getForRuntime` — main/host only, never reachable from the renderer
- // never `secrets.get` to renderer logs

A provider row has two independent refs — `secret:provider:<id>:api_key` and
`secret:provider:<id>:oauth` (D237/D240). The generic methods above serve both, so a
vendor-account credential needed no new host method. `ProviderPublic` therefore
reports `hasSecret` (true for **either** credential), `hasOauth`, and the
non-secret `oauthAccountLabel`; `providers.create` / `providers.update` accept
`oauthAccountLabel` and optional `headers` (stored in `config_json.headers`,
cleared with `{}`), and `providers.delete` clears both refs for
exactly one row. Login orchestration and token refresh stay in Electron main
and never reach this protocol — see [14-secrets-storage](14-secrets-storage.md)
§10. An OAuth row's headers are edited after the account exists and apply
to later refresh and inference; the vendor picker does not collect them.

### Settings
- `settings.get`
- `settings.set` — optional `networkProxy` (`system` / `direct` / `custom`).
  Custom requires an `http`/`https`/`socks5` URL. host-core uses the stored
  value for marketplace `curl --proxy` and does not put it on process env.

### Sessions
- `session.list` — returns summaries with host-authoritative `messageCount`
  alongside the existing session metadata
- `session.create` — accepts optional `thinkingLevel` and optional
  `inheritPermissionFromSessionId`; when present, the host copies the existing
  session's persisted permission mode atomically, while omission preserves the
  existing `inherit` default. Missing/null thinking level defaults to `off`.
- `session.fork` — accepts `sessionId`, an optional caller-provided display
  `title`, and optional `throughMessageId`; creates
  one independent session from the source's current active canonical
  transcript, truncated inclusively at the selected message when supplied.
  The child inherits project/provider/model/mode/thinking and
  permission configuration, receives new message/tool-call ids, and starts
  without turns, revisions, notifications, artifacts, grants, or scratch data.
  Missing sources return `NOT_FOUND`; Electron rejects active sources with
  `AGENT_BUSY` before forwarding and normalizes the host's persisted
  running-turn `CONFLICT` fallback to `AGENT_BUSY`; an unknown source or
  `throughMessageId` returns `NOT_FOUND`
- `session.get` — accepts an optional renderer read window:
  `messageBefore` is the exclusive zero-based end offset, `messageLimit` is
  the positive page size, and `contentLimit` is the positive character budget
  for the derived display projection. The response includes
  `messageStart` and `hasMoreBefore` when a window is requested. Omitting all
  three options returns the complete lossless UI projection for sidecar and
  mutation callers. Window offsets are physical transcript message-line
  positions, clamped against the cached transcript layout rather than the
  deduplicated session index counter, and a window is served by seeking to its
  first selected line instead of scanning the history before it.
- `session.delete`
- `session.getScratchPath` — the session's scratch directory (D114), created
  on demand
- `session.rename({ id, title })` trims and validates the title at the host
  boundary. It accepts 1–80 Unicode code points and returns `{ ok: boolean }`;
  blank or overlong titles are `INVALID_PARAMS`. A successful rename changes
  only session metadata and does not update `updated_at`, transcript content,
  message count, or historical notification title snapshots.
- `session.configure` — atomically persists `mode`, `providerId`, `modelId`,
  and optional `thinkingLevel` for the next pi turn; omitting/null
  `thinkingLevel` preserves the current value; invalid modes or levels return
  `INVALID_PARAMS`; mode is `plan | goal | agent` and changing any session
  configuration is allowed only while idle and without a pending/queued/running
  Plan or Goal record
- `session.moveProject({ sessionId, projectPath })` moves an idle session to a
  project and returns `{ session }` carrying the canonical project path. It
  upserts the project row and updates only `sessions.project_id` and
  `updated_at`; transcript, revisions, artifacts, notifications, and scratch
  data stay with the session. Blank ids or paths are `INVALID_PARAMS`, an
  unknown session is `NOT_FOUND`, and a session with a running turn is
  `CONFLICT` so a live agent never switches instruction roots mid-turn.
  Additive RPC; no protocol version bump.
- `session.appendMessage`
- `session.saveInflightMessage` — Electron-main-only checkpoint of the
  assistant reply currently streaming, including the finished `message_end`
  snapshot: `{ sessionId, turnId?, message }`
  atomically replaces `sessions/<id>.inflight.json` (D299, D327, spec 04 §2.1).
  Returns `{ ok, saved }`; `saved` is false for a message without visible text
  or for an id that is already indexed (the final row landed first), and in the
  latter case any leftover checkpoint is removed. Non-assistant roles are
  `INVALID_PARAMS`-class failures. A `completed`/`error` `session.endTurn`
  deletes the file only when that id is already indexed.
- `session.recoverInflightMessages` — Electron-main-only post-drain sweep
  (D327). Promotes leftover checkpoints whose final row never landed,
  including `completed` turns as `complete`. Boot recovery skips completed
  leftovers so the outbox can append first. Returns `{ ok, count }`.
- `session.appendCompaction` — sidecar-only append of the newest typed
  model-context checkpoint. It requires non-empty checkpoint/summary/boundary
  ids and non-negative `tokensBefore`; it does not insert a message/search row
  or change the visible transcript projection
- `session.replaceMessages` — atomic transcript rewrite (temp-file rename +
  one index transaction, D119) used by message delete and unanswered
  renderer smart-stop undo; it preserves the
  newest checkpoint only while both its boundary and optional first-kept id
  remain valid in the rewritten prefix, and it carries each surviving message's
  owning `turn_id` across the rewrite. It is only safe from a caller that owns
  the whole transcript for the duration of the call: any rewrite from a snapshot
  taken outside the RPC lock can delete a message appended in between.
  Regenerating and retrying use `session.truncateFrom` instead so the kept
  prefix never crosses the JSON-RPC pipe (ADR 0216)
- `session.truncateFrom` — host-owned suffix cut for regenerate / retry /
  edit-resend: `{ sessionId, fromMessageId?, truncateBefore? }`. Identity
  wins; an unknown `fromMessageId` is `NOT_FOUND`. Under the state lock it
  aborts a leftover running turn, archives the discarded regenerate tail
  (refreshing the stamped variant, or minting an inactive one), rewrites the
  kept prefix, and drops the in-flight checkpoint. Returns
  `{ ok, keptCount, discardedCount, abortedTurnId, revision }` where `revision`
  is the pager stamp for the upcoming user prompt, or null when the discarded
  tail has no user root. No transcript snapshot is in the request or the
  result. Additive on protocol v11 (ADR 0216)

- `session.saveRevision` — archive a regenerate branch under
  `(sessionId, rootUserId)`. With `revisionIndex`, refresh that existing
  variant's payload in place (the branch grew since it was archived) instead
  of minting a new index; the DB row keeps its identity and active flag and
  only `message_count` changes
- `session.saveActiveRevision` — archive the branch of the newest
  revision-bearing user root as its active revision and stamp that root's pager
  metadata, all under the RPC lock. The stamp rewrites one transcript line
  instead of the file, so a concurrent `session.appendMessage` survives.
  Returns `{ saved: null }` when the session owns no regenerate history.
  An already-archived active variant is refreshed, not skipped.
  Turn-completion callers use this instead of
  `session.get` + `session.replaceMessages`
- `session.listRevisions` — list linear variants for a root user family
- `session.activateRevision` — replace live transcript with `prefix + branch`
  and stamp root pager metadata. Before the switch it re-archives the live
  branch of that family from the durable transcript (refreshing the variant
  the live root's `activeRevision` stamp names, or storing a stamped but
  never-archived branch as its own variant), so nothing appended since the
  last archive is lost. When the family is present in the durable transcript,
  the prefix in front of the restored branch is taken from there rather than
  from the caller. Surviving messages keep their owning `turn_id`
- `session.beginTurn({ sessionId, providerId?, modelId?, sessionMessageId? })` —
  starts one durable turn. When `sessionMessageId` is present, host-core
  atomically verifies that the queued collaboration delivery targets this
  session, rechecks its permission ceiling, claims the delivery, and binds the
  new turn to its message id. A collaboration turn cannot be started from
  caller-supplied replacement text.
- `session.queuePush` / `session.queueList` / `session.queueRemove` — the
  Host-owned turn queue (D386 / ADR 0213, schema v15); push is idempotent per
  principal and key, bounded at eight entries per session
- `session.endTurn` — atomically moves a running turn to its terminal state and
  conditionally returns the newly created notification for `completed`/`error`;
  returns no notification when `createNotification=false`, for `aborted`, or
  for an already-terminal turn. It also settles the session's in-flight reply
  checkpoint (D299): `completed`/`error` remove it; `recoverInflight: true`
  (sent when the sidecar is gone and no final row can follow) promotes a
  checkpoint whose final row never landed into the transcript as an `aborted`
  assistant message and returns it as `recovered`; a plain `aborted` (user
  Stop) leaves the checkpoint for the arriving final row to supersede
- `session.import` — atomically imports one converted session; a non-empty
  project path is normalized and upserted into `projects` before the session
  references it; returns `{ imported, skipped }`

Plugin-owned session methods are additive to protocol v11 and are called only by
Electron main after plugin permission and manifest-source checks:

- `plugin.session.import` — import one host-owned session with an idempotency
  key `(pluginId, source, externalId)`; the host generates ids and binds to a
  project only when the caller supplies an existing `projectId` created by
  `projects.create`; the historical `projectPath` remains metadata
- `plugin.session.importBatch` — bounded `skip` or all-or-nothing `fail` batch
- `plugin.session.list` / `plugin.session.get` / `plugin.session.listMessages` —
  read only the calling plugin's active imported sessions
- `plugin.session.rename` — rename an owned active imported session
- `plugin.session.delete` — `trash` hides and retains the transcript; `purge`
  removes it and permits re-import
- Successful plugin session mutations cause Electron main to emit one
  `sessionsChanged` renderer event; the renderer refreshes the session list,
  and plugins do not emit this UI synchronization event.

Host-internal session collaboration methods are additive to protocol v11 and
are called by Electron main only after the reviewed plugin gateway has checked
the plugin permission and active Agent tool invocation. They are not renderer
or general MCP operations:

- `session.collaboration.spawn` — create a bounded Agent worker session that
  inherits the source project's, thinking, and permission configuration, create
  its first `task` delivery, and return the real target `sessionId` plus the
  message record. Worker creation is limited per parent and plugin; a worker
  cannot create another worker.
- `session.collaboration.send` — enqueue a `task` or `message` delivery to an
  existing Agent session. The host binds `sourceSessionId` and `sourceTurnId`
  to the current plugin tool invocation, enforces idempotency, a target inbox
  bound, the source permission ceiling, and a bounded autonomous hop count.
- `session.collaboration.message` — read one durable delivery by message id for
  Electron's dispatch and provenance paths.
- `session.collaboration.status` / `session.collaboration.result` — return a
  bounded status/result projection without loading a complete worker
  transcript. `result` may select a delivery by `messageId` or `turnId`.
- `session.collaboration.pending` — list queued completion callbacks for the
  Electron drain; `fail` records a dispatch failure and creates the requested
  failure callback once; `settle` derives the result from the persisted turn
  and creates at most one completion callback.
- `session.collaboration.cancel` — cancel queued deliveries or interrupt their
  exact currently-bound turns while retaining the target session and history.

The ledger is durable across a host restart. A queued entry with its
`turn_queue.session_message_id` remains held for a new Agent Host controller;
an unclaimed or running delivery is marked `interrupted` by the startup fence
and is never replayed automatically. Transcript provenance is host-derived and
cannot be forged or removed by `session.appendMessage` or transcript
replacement.

The host rejects unknown roles, non-RFC3339 or non-monotonic timestamps, and
oversized/deep payloads. Tool values are sanitized for host-reserved keys. The
per-plugin rolling limits are 10 single imports, 5 batch imports, and 20
deletes per 60 seconds. P2/P3 methods are not present in protocol v11.

### Stats

- `stats.getTokenUsageHistory` — roll up completed `turns` token columns and
  `usage_json` cache/reasoning fields into local-calendar `day` / `week` /
  `month` buckets. Additive RPC; no protocol version bump. Default range is
  bounded (53 weeks / 52 weeks / 24 months). `week` uses ISO week year.
  Empty buckets in range are returned as zero rows so a calendar consumer sees a
  complete window. `session.endTurn.usage` is the durable turn total: parent
  assistant messages plus settled subagent usage, not a rewrite of
  `message.usage`. The user-facing dashboard is plugin `pi.token-insights`
  (D335 / ADR 0173), not a Settings destination.

### Plan and Goal state and approvals

Both contract kinds share these methods; the optional `kind`
(`plan | goal`, default `plan` so a pre-D198 sidecar still works) selects which
contract is being negotiated.

- `plans.enter` — accepts only the active Agent turn's `sessionId`, `turnId`,
  and `toolCallId` plus the `kind`; host-core performs the mode transition to
  that kind's mode with a compare-and-swap update and emits `plans.changed`
  carrying the `kind`. An unrecognized `kind` fails with `INVALID_PARAMS`
- `plans.submit` — writes the host-owned artifact under the kind's directory and
  creates a pending proposal whose `kind` is persisted on the row
- `plans.pending` — returns only pending approval rows, the session planning
  state, and the `kind` of the contract being negotiated (the pending row's kind,
  falling back to the session's own contract mode); renderer reload does not
  extend the absolute deadline while the host remains alive and does not restore
  terminal cards
- `plans.resolve` — validates one matching approve/reject response and, for
  approval, commits the selected permission mode and `execution_state = queued`
- `plans.queuedExecutions` / `plans.claimExecution` /
  `plans.finishExecution` — consume and transition execution fields on the
  same approval row; the claimed execution reports its `kind` so the sidecar can
  select the matching execution instruction
- `plans.abort` — marks pending approval work interrupted; it never replays or
  changes an already-approved session back to its contract mode

### Scheduled tasks

- `scheduled.list` / `scheduled.create` / `scheduled.update` /
  `scheduled.delete`
- `scheduled.import` — imports task records and normalizes their persisted mode
- `scheduled.run` / `scheduled.finishRun` / `scheduled.listRuns`

The wire `ScheduledTask.mode` is a normalized projection of the durable
`config_json.mode`; create, update, and import map legacy `chat` to `plan` and
default missing values to `agent`. `scheduled.run` reads the selected task's
persisted mode; a `plan` or `goal` task fails with
`PLAN_REQUIRES_INTERACTIVE_SESSION` before creating a session or run. It never
uses `settings.defaultMode` as the task mode.

Canonical thinking levels at the host boundary are:

```text
off | minimal | low | medium | high | xhigh | max
```

Session summaries/details always return `thinkingLevel`. Assistant messages
may return `thinking`; host storage maps it to a canonical content block rather
than appending it to answer `content`.

### Tools
- `tools.list`
- `tools.execute`
- `tools.abort`
- `tools.output` notifications for ordered `stdout`/`stderr` chunks

### Shells
- `commandShells.list`
- `settings.set` with a partial settings object; omitted fields are preserved,
  and a changed effective `defaultCommandShell` is accepted only when every
  session has no active turn and no pending/queued/running Plan/Goal work

Tool execution starts only after admission. Shell spawn retries transient
resource exhaustion (`EAGAIN` / `WouldBlock`) with bounded backoff, never
retries a command after it has started, and reaps timed-out children before
releasing the execution slot.

`session.appendMessage` is idempotent by message id. Electron main may keep
message appends in its application-owned outbox while host-core is restarting;
the outbox flushes in order after a successful handshake. A missing sessions
row is restored from the live JSONL (or created as a stub under the same id
when the file is gone) so a queued outbox can drain (D318). `session.delete`
drops that session's outbox entries. In-flight checkpoints never go through
the outbox: a checkpoint is only meaningful against a live host, and replaying
one after the final row would be wrong.

### Permissions
- `permissions.evaluate`
- `permissions.resolve`
- `permissions.pending` (D374: open requests as Host state)
- `permissions.listSessionGrants`
- `permissions.clearSessionGrants`

### Plugins
- `plugins.list`
- `plugins.loadDev`
- `plugins.installFromPath`
- `plugins.installFromPackage` — install a `.piplug` archive after checksum
  verification
- `plugins.enable`
- `plugins.disable`
- `plugins.uninstall`
- `plugins.getPermissions`
- `plugins.grantPermissions` / `plugins.revokePermissions` — change the
  granted set; the runtime enforces the intersection of declared and granted
- `plugins.setAutoUpdate`
- `plugins.setScope` — activation scope (ADR 0056)
- `plugins.resolveExecution` — resolve which plugin tools/skills/MCP servers
  are active for a session's project before a turn starts

### Marketplace
- `market.refresh` — fetch and cache the catalog from the configured URL
- `market.search` / `market.getDetail`
- `market.install` — download, verify (`PLUGIN_INTEGRITY`,
  `PLUGIN_MARKET_*`), and install one catalog release
- `market.checkUpdates` / `market.applyUpdates`

### Providers and models
- `providers.list` / `providers.get` / `providers.create` /
  `providers.update` / `providers.delete`
- `providers.getSecret` — main/host only, never reachable from the renderer
- `providers.listModels` / `providers.cacheModels` — discovered model rows
  and their host-side cache (ADR 0027 / ADR 0134)
- `providers.testConnection`

### Agent capabilities (skills, subagents, MCP servers)
- `skills.list` / `skills.active` / `skills.read` / `skills.create` /
  `skills.update` / `skills.remove` / `skills.import` /
  `skills.setEnabled` / `skills.setScope` — user skill documents
  (`SKILL_INVALID` on validation failure)
- `agents.list` / `agents.active` / `agents.read` / `agents.create` /
  `agents.update` / `agents.remove` / `agents.setEnabled` /
  `agents.setScope` — user subagent documents (`SUBAGENT_INVALID`)
- `mcp.list` / `mcp.active` / `mcp.upsert` / `mcp.remove` /
  `mcp.setEnabled` / `mcp.setScope` — user MCP server definitions
  (`MCP_INVALID`)

`*.active` returns the entries that apply to the given project after
activation-scope filtering (`CAPABILITY_INVALID` for an unknown scope).

### Search, artifacts, keyboard
- `search.query` — global search across sessions, projects, and settings
  destinations (ADR 0034)
- `artifacts.list` — Plan/Goal checkpoint artifacts for a session
- `keyboard.setGlobalShortcut` — host-owned native fallback for the plugin
  launcher chord where Electron cannot register it

### Audit
- `audit.append`

### Notification (D117)
- `notification.list`
- `notification.markRead`
- `notification.markAllRead`
- `notification.clear`

## 4a. Notification contracts (protocol v4)

```ts
type AppNotification = {
  id: string;
  kind: "task.completed" | "task.failed";
  sessionId: string;
  sessionTitle: string;
  turnId: string;
  errorCode?: string;
  createdAt: string; // ISO-8601 UTC
  readAt?: string | null;
};

type SessionEndTurnParams = {
  turnId: string;
  status: "completed" | "error" | "aborted";
  errorCode?: string;
  usage?: unknown;
  createNotification?: boolean; // default true; Electron supplies visibility decision
};

type SessionEndTurnResult = {
  ok: boolean; // false when the turn was missing/already terminal
  notification?: AppNotification; // omitted when no row was inserted
};

type NotificationListParams = {
  unreadOnly?: boolean; // default false
  limit?: number;       // default/max 200
};

type NotificationListResult = {
  notifications: AppNotification[]; // newest first
  unreadCount: number;               // global count, independent of filter
};
```

- `notification.markRead({ id }) -> { ok }` is idempotent. `ok=false` means
  the id does not exist; an already-read row remains successful.
- `notification.markAllRead({}) -> { ok: true }` updates every unread row in
  one transaction.
- `notification.clear({}) -> { ok: true }` deletes inbox rows only.
- No `notification.created` JSON-RPC server notification is emitted. Electron
  receives the inserted record directly from `session.endTurn`, avoiding a
  second ordering channel between terminal turn persistence and UI refresh.
- `createNotification=false` suppresses only inbox insertion; the running turn
  still reaches its requested terminal state in the same transaction. Missing
  or non-boolean values default to true so unknown/stale UI state cannot lose a
  notification.
- `sessionTitle` is the stable session-name snapshot stored with the row.
  Localized event title/body prose is derived by Electron/renderer and never
  crosses host RPC.

## 5. Tool execute contract

### `tools.execute` params

```ts
type ToolsExecuteParams = {
  sessionId: string
  turnId?: string
  toolCallId: string
  toolName: string
  args: unknown
  /** Diagnostic/request context only; never used for authorization. */
  requestedMode?: "plan" | "goal" | "agent"
  expectedCommandShellId?: CommandShellId
  /** Bash only: dialect pinned by the same runtime turn. */
  expectedCommandShellDialect?: "powershell" | "cmd" | "posix"
  /** Bash only: host default 60000; accepted override 1000..21600000. */
  timeoutMs?: number
}
```

Authoritative mode and workspace resolution are session-scoped:

1. Host loads `sessionId` and resolves its persisted `project_id`/path.
2. Host reads the persisted `sessions.mode` and validates it as `plan | agent`.
   A conflicting `requestedMode` is ignored for authorization and recorded only
   as diagnostic data.
3. That path becomes the tool sandbox root for permission preview, execution,
   artifact paths, and audit context. A tool's explicit `path` may name an
   outside location only after the host applies the outside-path permission
   rule; successful external results retain an absolute canonical path.
4. The mutable `workspace.get` selection is not consulted for a valid durable
   session, so switching a retained project tab cannot redirect a background
   call.
5. A durable path-less session resolves no root and receives
   `WORKSPACE_REQUIRED` where the tool requires one. A selected project is not
   inherited.
6. Legacy calls whose session does not exist may temporarily fall back to the
   selected workspace; new renderer flows must always provide a valid
   `sessionId`.
7. A database/session-resolution error returns `INTERNAL` and fails closed;
   only a confirmed missing session may use the legacy fallback.

For `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`/`Write`/`Edit`, the host classifies an explicit path
outside the workspace and scratch roots before the low-risk auto-allow rule.
`auto` executes it, while `ask` and `accept-edits` emit
`permissions.request`; denial, timeout, or cancellation returns `TOOL_DENIED`
without executing the operation. Relative `..` and symlink escapes use the
same classification. Bash's working directory and implicit recursive walks do
not inherit this exception.

Before generic permission evaluation, host-core applies the mode policy:

- Plan and Goal allow `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `BrowserPreview`, `Bash`, and the
  kind's submit tool (`SubmitPlan` / `SubmitGoal`) as applicable to the live
  planning state.
- Plan and Goal deny `Write`, `Edit`, every plugin tool, and unknown tools under
  all permission modes and grants. The host reads the session's **durable** mode
  for this check, so a sidecar claiming `agent` in `tools.execute` cannot widen
  it, and the `*_IN_PLAN` error codes are shared by both kinds.
- Plan and Goal `Bash` follows the resolved permission mode: `ask` and
  `accept-edits`
  emit `permissions.request`; `auto` executes without confirmation and may
  mutate. The host re-resolves the effective shell ID/dialect and requires the
  exact `expectedCommandShellId` and `expectedCommandShellDialect` before
  permission evaluation and again before spawn; it streams stdout/stderr
  separately. A configured shell may fall back to the first available platform
  shell before the turn pin is created, but execution never changes shell
  after the pin.
- Agent applies the normal registered-tool and permission policy.

The visible tool list is not the security boundary; a forged RPC call is
authorized by this host-side matrix.

### result

```ts
type ToolsExecuteResult = {
  toolCallId: string
  ok: boolean
  isError?: boolean
  content: unknown
  durationMs: number
  denied?: boolean
  errorCode?: string
  // Workspace Write/Edit results may include content.details.review. The
  // record is persisted with the tool message and is independent of Git.
  // Bash command failures preserve content.exitCode/stdout/stderr while
  // setting ok=false, isError=true, and errorCode=TOOL_FAILED.
  // The agent runtime forwards isError into the tool transcript without
  // dropping the structured content/details needed for recovery.
}
```

### 5.1 Plan and Goal submission and approval contracts

`SubmitPlan` and `SubmitGoal` are handled as host transitions before generic
tool execution. The host preserves the exact Markdown bytes in a new unique
artifact under the kind's directory before publishing the proposal.

```ts
// Identical shape for both kinds; the tool name selects the kind.
type SubmitPlanParams = {
  title: string;
  markdown: string;
  question: string;
};

type ProposalKind = "plan" | "goal";

type PlanningState = "inactive" | "planning" | "awaiting_approval";

type GlobalPermissionMode = "ask" | "accept-edits" | "auto";

type PlanApprovalAction = "approve" | "reject";

type PlanProposalStatus =
  | "pending" | "approved" | "rejected"
  | "expired" | "interrupted";

type PlanExecutionState =
  | "queued" | "running" | "completed" | "interrupted";

type PlanArtifact = {
  relativePath: string; // `.pi/plan/<unique-name>.md` or `.pi/goal/<unique-name>.md`
  sha256: string;
  sizeBytes: number;
};

type PlanProposal = {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  turnId: string;
  toolCallId: string;
  // Which contract this approval carries; rows written before the
  // discriminator existed read back as `plan`.
  kind: ProposalKind;
  plan: string;
  markdown: string;
  title: string;
  question: string;
  status: PlanProposalStatus;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  expiresAt?: string;
  resolvedAt?: string;
  action?: PlanApprovalAction;
  targetPermissionMode?: GlobalPermissionMode;
  errorCode?: string;
  artifact?: PlanArtifact;
  version: number;
  executionId?: string;
  executionState?: PlanExecutionState;
};

type PlanExecution = {
  id: string;
  proposalId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  // Which contract was approved; selects the sidecar's execution instruction.
  kind: ProposalKind;
  plan: string;
  title: string;
  question: string;
  artifact: PlanArtifact;
  targetPermissionMode: GlobalPermissionMode;
  state: PlanExecutionState;
};

type PlansPendingResult = {
  plans: PlanProposal[];
  state?: PlanningState;
  // The contract being negotiated: the pending row's kind, else the session's
  // own contract mode. Absent when nothing is being negotiated.
  kind?: ProposalKind;
};

type PlanResolveIdentity = {
  proposalId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  turnId: string;
  toolCallId: string;
  version?: number;
};

type PlanResolveRequest =
  | (PlanResolveIdentity & {
      action: "approve";
      targetPermissionMode: GlobalPermissionMode;
    })
  | (PlanResolveIdentity & { action: "reject" });

type PlanResolutionResult = {
  ok: boolean;
  proposal: PlanProposal;
  state: PlanningState;
  action?: PlanApprovalAction;
  targetPermissionMode?: GlobalPermissionMode;
  execution?: PlanExecution;
};
```

Host notifications:

```text
method: "plans.changed"
params: {
  sessionId: string
  state: PlanningState
  kind?: ProposalKind
  proposalId?: string
  proposal?: PlanProposal
  action?: PlanApprovalAction
  targetPermissionMode?: GlobalPermissionMode | null
  execution?: PlanExecution | null
}

type ToolsOutputParams = {
  sessionId: string
  toolCallId: string
  commandShellId: CommandShellId
  stream: CommandShellOutputStream
  chunk: string
}

method: "tools.output"
params: ToolsOutputParams
```

`plans.changed` is emitted for Plan or Goal entry, submission, resolution,
execution claim/finish, and abort. Its top-level params are exactly the fields
shown; fields not applicable to a transition are omitted, and `kind` names the
contract so the renderer can pick the right mode chip and approval copy without
inspecting the projected state. For `plans.resolve`, the
host emits `targetPermissionMode` and `execution` as JSON `null` when no value
exists. Electron forwards this notification unchanged through
the shared `IPC.event.plansChanged` renderer channel.

`plans.resolve` accepts only an authenticated, still-pending request whose
proposal, session, turn, tool-call, and version match. `approve` requires an
explicit permission mode and atomically commits the `plan_approvals` row to
`status = approved`, assigns `execution_id`, sets `execution_state = queued`,
sets `sessions.mode = agent`, and stores the selected
`sessions.permission_mode`; that selection is not written into app settings
as the next approval default. Ask remains the product default. The same Agent then receives a new provider
request with Agent tools.

`reject` records `rejected` and leaves the session in its contract mode (Plan or
Goal). The absolute
30-minute deadline records `expired` with `PLAN_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT`. Abort, host
restart, sidecar restart, or persistence failure records `interrupted`. Before
serving RPC after startup, the host transactionally interrupts prior pending
approvals and queued/running execution states. Pending, queued, and running
work is never replayed; queued/running interruption after approval leaves the
session in Agent. The process epoch is internal and is not a wire or database
field.

### 5.2 Shell catalog

```ts
type CommandShellId =
  | "windows-powershell"
  | "windows-pwsh"
  | "cmd"
  | "git-bash"
  | "bash";

type CommandShellOption = {
  id: CommandShellId;
  label: string;
  dialect: "powershell" | "cmd" | "posix";
  available: boolean;
  isDefault: boolean;
};

type CommandShellCatalog = {
  configuredId: CommandShellId | null;
  effective: CommandShellOption | null;
  fallback: boolean;
  choices: CommandShellOption[];
};

type CommandShellOutputStream = "stdout" | "stderr";
```

`commandShells.list` returns the host discovery result. Settings writes store
only a catalog ID and reject unknown, unavailable, or wrong-platform IDs with
`COMMAND_SHELL_INVALID`. If a persisted ID later becomes unavailable, the
catalog selects the first available platform shell and sets `fallback: true`.
A Bash request includes the pinned effective ID and dialect from the same turn;
host-core rejects a changed ID or dialect with `COMMAND_SHELL_CHANGED` before
permission evaluation and before spawn. Identity is not an executable path
hash.

## 6. Permission request notification

Host may emit:

```ts
method: "permissions.request"
params: {
  requestId: string
  sessionId: string
  toolCallId: string
  toolName: string
  risk: "low" | "medium" | "high"
  argsPreview: unknown
  reason: string
  timeoutMs: 120000
}
```

Electron/UI resolves via:

```ts
method: "permissions.resolve"
params: {
  requestId: string
  decision: "allow-once" | "allow-session" | "deny"
}
```

Timeout behavior (**D005**): after 120s unresolved → deny.

`permissions.pending` returns the open requests as Host state (D374/D375):
`{ requests: PendingPermission[] }`, oldest first, optionally scoped by
`sessionId`. Each entry carries the same fields as the `permissions.request`
notification plus `createdAt`, `expiresAt`, and `remainingMs`. Requests past
the timeout are omitted. A client that attaches after the notification was
emitted reads this list and answers through the unchanged
`permissions.resolve`; the notification path itself does not change.

## 7. Error codes

JSON-RPC errors carry a numeric `code` plus `data.errorCode`, the stable
string from [08-error-codes](08-error-codes.md). Several string codes share a
numeric slot; the string is the contract, the number is transport detail.

| code | errorCode | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1000 | INTERNAL | unexpected host failure |
| 1001 | UNAUTHORIZED | missing/invalid handshake or capability |
| 1001 | HOST_SHUTTING_DOWN | the host is draining after EOF and refused the call |
| 1002 | INVALID_PARAMS | schema validation failed |
| 1002 | MODEL_ALIAS_TOO_LONG | provider row alias exceeds 60 code points |
| 1003 | NOT_FOUND | entity missing (legacy slot, kept for old callers) |
| 1006 | RATE_LIMITED | a per-caller budget window was exhausted |
| 1007 | NOT_FOUND | entity missing |
| 1007 | SESSION_NOT_FOUND | the named session does not exist; tool requests never fall back to the global workspace |
| 1008 | CONFLICT | busy/conflict state |
| 1008 | AGENT_BUSY | the session has a running turn |
| 1009 | PLUGIN_INVALID | manifest/validation failure |
| 1010 | PLUGIN_LOAD_FAILED | enable/load failure |
| 1011 | PROTOCOL_MISMATCH | `app.handshake` protocol version mismatch |
| 1012 | PLUGIN_INTEGRITY | package checksum/signature mismatch |
| 1013 | PLUGIN_PERMISSION_DENIED | plugin lacks the permission the call needs |
| 1014 | PLUGIN_NETWORK | marketplace download/catalog fetch failed |
| 1015 | MCP_INVALID | user MCP server definition failed validation |
| 1015 | PLAN_* | every Plan/Goal checkpoint failure (`PLAN_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT`, `PLAN_APPROVAL_STALE`, `PLAN_APPROVAL_INTERRUPTED`, `PLAN_SESSION_NOT_FOUND`, `PLAN_WORKSPACE_REQUIRED`, …) shares this slot; the string code distinguishes them |
| 1016 | SKILL_INVALID | user skill document failed validation |
| 1017 | SUBAGENT_INVALID | user subagent document failed validation |
| 1018 | CAPABILITY_INVALID | agent capability root/scope setting failed validation |
| -32029 | HOST_OVERLOADED | RPC dispatcher capacity exhausted |
| -32601 | — | unknown method |
| -32700 | — | unparseable request line |
| 1002 | LIMIT_EXCEEDED | an NDJSON request line over 64 MiB; Electron rejects the write before it reaches the pipe; if the host still sees it, the remainder of the line is drained, the reply keeps the request id when it can be peeked from the prefix, and the stdin reader keeps running |


Tool outcomes (`TOOL_DENIED`, `TOOL_TIMEOUT`, `PATH_OUTSIDE_WORKSPACE`,
`WORKSPACE_PATH_DENIED`, `WRITE_DISABLED_IN_PLAN`, `SHELL_NOT_FOUND`,
`COMMAND_SHELL_CHANGED`, …) are not JSON-RPC errors: `tools.execute` returns
`ok: false` with `errorCode` in the result (§5).

## 8. Concurrency / ordering

1. Requests may be concurrent within the dispatcher cap. Read/search tools may
   run in parallel; `Write`/`Edit` are bounded and FIFO-ordered per session,
   with at most one mutation in flight for a session.
2. Different sessions may continue concurrently across retained project tabs;
   each resolves its own project root and grants
3. Notifications may arrive anytime after handshake
4. `tools.output` preserves stdout/stderr separation and notification order;
   it is scoped to its session/tool call and has no turn or ordering fields;
   final results remain bounded
5. Abort is idempotent and shuts down the complete Bash process tree
6. Plan and Goal approval requests are proposal/session/turn/tool-call/version
   scoped;
   only one pending approval and one queued/running execution exists per
   session, and resolution is serialized by host-core
7. Startup transactionally interrupts pending approvals and queued/running
   execution states before RPC service. Late renderer responses fail closed;
   pending interruption keeps the session's contract mode and an
   already-approved queued/running interruption keeps Agent.
8. A session fork is one host-owned snapshot operation. The source transcript
   is never rewritten, and a handled child write/index failure leaves no
   visible session or orphan transcript file. A process crash follows D119's
   existing orphan-transcript recovery policy.
9. A message-scoped fork is identical except that the canonical snapshot ends
   inclusively at `throughMessageId`. It still remaps message/tool-call ids and
   creates no runtime or revision state, so later child reseed/cache state is
   isolated by the new session id.

## 9. Logging rules

- Never log API keys/secrets
- Tool args may be redacted in audit previews
- Every tools.execute gets trace id = `toolCallId`

## 10. Acceptance

1. Electron spawns host and completes handshake
2. health method returns ok
3. denied tool path returns `TOOL_DENIED`
4. timeout path returns deny decision after 120s
5. switching the selected workspace from A to B does not change the tool root
   of a call issued by session A
6. Protocol v4 `session.endTurn` creates/returns exactly one notification for
   unseen completed/failed turns and none for visible-current, aborted, or
   repeated terminal updates
7. Notification list/unread/read-all/clear round-trip through host-core and
   remain bounded to the newest 200 durable rows
8. Forking an idle session produces an independently mutable child with the
   same active transcript and durable execution configuration while leaving
   the source and its regenerate revisions unchanged
9. Forking through a message excludes every later source row and rejects an
   unknown message without creating a child
10. A forged `requestedMode` cannot authorize a tool against the durable mode;
    Plan and Goal deny Write/Edit/plugin/unknown tools and apply permission
    prompts to Bash according to `ask`/`accept-edits`/`auto`
11. SubmitPlan and SubmitGoal write exact Markdown bytes to a unique
    `.pi/plan/*.md` or `.pi/goal/*.md` file with
    hash/size and structured title/question fields; only matching
    approve/reject responses can resolve the live `plan_approvals` row, and a
    submit tool run against the other kind fails with `PLAN_KIND_MISMATCH`
    without writing an artifact
12. Plan and Goal expiry, abort, crash, scheduled rejection, and stale responses
    produce the documented durable statuses and events
13. Bash validates the pinned shell ID/dialect, streams stdout/stderr, enforces
    the 60s default/bounded override, and shuts down the complete process tree
