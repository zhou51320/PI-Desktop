# 12. Provider Config Schema

## 1. Storage location

Owned by Rust host DB/settings store.

Tables (canonical DDL in [04-data-storage](04-data-storage.md) §4.3–4.4, §4.11):

- `providers`
- `models` (single catalog table; `source: bundled | discovered | user` replaces the old `provider_models` / `model_catalog_cache` split)
- `secrets_meta` (no raw secret values)
- recent-model MRU lives in `kv(ns='cache')`, not a table

## 2. Provider record JSON schema (logical)

```

`models[].alias` is an optional display label (ADR 0192). `models[].id`
remains the identity sent to the provider and the alias is never used for
provider or model resolution; UI naming and clearing rules are specified in
[04-ux/08-component-spec](../04-ux/08-component-spec.md). Host-core trims the
alias, drops a blank one, and enforces the 60-character limit by rejecting an
over-long alias with `MODEL_ALIAS_TOO_LONG`.

`compatibility.supportsReasoning` and
`compatibility.supportedThinkingLevels` remain readable for stored-record and
older-client compatibility, but Electron main ignores them during runtime
model resolution. The public provider shape is enriched from the local
models.dev snapshot. Unknown free-form models initially expose
`supportsReasoning=false` and `supportedThinkingLevels=["off"]`; Settings may
still persist an explicit thinking-level binding for an endpoint that supports
it. The raw secret and internal compatibility JSON remain hidden.

Anthropic Messages providers may store either the service root or a URL ending
in `/v1`. Model discovery preserves that configured path and requests
`/v1/models` exactly once; runtime request setup removes the trailing `/v1`
before invoking pi-ai, whose Anthropic SDK adds `/v1` to the messages route.
Both forms therefore send messages to the configured service's
`/v1/messages` endpoint rather than a doubled `/v1/v1/messages` path.

For OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions models, the runtime defaults
`compat.supportsDeveloperRole` to `false`, so system instructions are sent as
`role: "system"` even when the selected model supports reasoning. A resolved
model record may explicitly set it to `true` for an upstream that accepts
`role: "developer"`; this override is model-scoped.

`authKind: "oauth"` marks a vendor-account row (ADR 0095, D237, D240): the credential
is an OAuth grant under `secret:provider:<id>:oauth` rather than a pasted key,
so the row carries no `secretRef` for it and launches with an empty key. The
last two apiStyle values are vendor-account wire APIs — `openai_codex_responses`
(the Codex conversation envelope) and `pi_messages` (the radius gateway) — and
are not offered in the custom-provider dialog because neither works against a
hand-typed base URL with a pasted key. A vendor row's style is not fixed by the
vendor: GitHub Copilot serves Anthropic, Chat Completions, and Responses
models, so the style follows the selected model and is rewritten on each model
change. The vendor account editor uses the same multi-model binding controls as
an AI service: authenticated catalog models and custom IDs can be selected,
and each binding persists its context window, max output tokens, thinking levels,
and default thinking level in `models`. `config_json.oauth.accountLabel` holds the non-secret display label for
the signed-in account.
Each successful login creates a new row even when another row has the same
`vendorKey`; the row id scopes the credential and runtime binding. The vendor
catalog exposes these rows as an `accounts` array with `providerId`, an optional
non-secret `accountLabel`, and a `connected` flag. The custom-provider dialog
does not edit or delete OAuth rows; the Vendor accounts card calls
`providers.delete` for the selected row.

`models` is the provider's selected model binding array. Each binding owns its
context/output limits and explicit thinking configuration. Published catalog
levels seed a newly selected known model, but the binding may enable any
canonical level so a proxy or newly released endpoint is configurable before
the catalog is updated. `defaultModelId` remains a
read compatibility field and is kept equal to the first binding when a new
provider is saved. When an older record has only `defaultModelId`, the host
materializes one binding on read with a 128,000 context window, 8,192 max
output, no enabled thinking levels, and a null default. The settings editor
still renders all canonical choices for that legacy binding, and the next write
stores the explicit binding array in `config_json.models`.

For context resolution, that 128,000 value is a backward-compatible generic
seed, not a reason to hide a published long-context limit. If models.dev now
publishes a positive `limit.context`, the effective runtime and inspector window
follow it; a non-default value entered in the model's Advanced controls remains
an explicit per-model override. Unknown IDs continue to use 128,000.

`availableForSubagents` is an optional, persisted opt-in on each model binding.
Host read/write and normalization preserve `true`; records created before this
field existed remain disabled by default. This flag is what Electron main uses
to build the delegation model catalog, so changing it survives provider edits
and application restarts.

`apiStyle: "opencode_go"` is a first-class OpenCode Go preset layered on the
OpenAI-compatible provider type. It persists as its own style so the UI can
identify the service, but runtime requests use the OpenAI Chat Completions
wire adapter. The Service select offers OpenCode Go next to named Zhipu
endpoints. The preset always uses `name: "OpenCode Go"` and
`baseUrl: "https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1"`; the common path is Service + API
key, with the host shown as a summary. Model discovery calls the fixed
`/models` endpoint with a Bearer key, and the raw key continues to follow the
normal secret-store path.

OpenCode Go (and any `opencode.ai` host) requires a stable
`x-opencode-session` header on LLM requests. Agent-runtime sends that header
plus `x-opencode-client: pi-desktop` and `User-Agent: pi-desktop/<APP_VERSION>`
on session turns, subagent turns, prompt enhancement, and plugin one-shots.
Caller-supplied headers override the client and User-Agent values; a missing
or empty session header is always restored from the conversation id.

`headers` is an optional per-row map stored in `config_json.headers`. Empty,
omitted, or update `{}` keeps the adapter default (pi-ai's `pi (…)` string,
Anthropic OAuth's `claude-cli/<version>`, or OpenCode's
`pi-desktop/<APP_VERSION>`). A non-empty map is last-writer on that row's
outbound HTTP — session turns, subagents, prompt enhancement, plugin one-shots,
`/models` discovery (including unsaved form values), connection tests, and
OAuth token refresh. A fetch wrapper is the last writer so Codex and the
Anthropic SDK cannot overwrite it. The same values are also placed on stream-
option headers so OpenCode's caller-wins rule stays true. Keys are
case-insensitive unique, at most 32 entries, name ≤ 256 bytes, value ≤ 4096
bytes, no CR/LF, names alphanumeric plus hyphen. Reserved keys
(`authorization`, `proxy-authorization`, `host`, `content-type`,
`content-length`, `cookie`, `set-cookie`, `connection`, `transfer-encoding`,
`te`, `trailer`, `upgrade`, `keep-alive`, `x-api-key`, `api-key`,
`chatgpt-account-id`, `x-opencode-session`) are rejected so this cannot smash
signing or app routing. This is not a secret. Leftover `config_json.userAgent`
migrates into `headers["User-Agent"]` on read; writing `headers` drops it.
Overriding Anthropic OAuth's `claude-cli/…` User-Agent can make Claude Pro/Max
reject the request. First OAuth login does not collect headers; they are
edited on the account after it exists. Advanced UI is a compact key/value
editor, not a dedicated User-Agent field.

Copilot OAuth rows also retain the static IDE identity headers from the pinned
pi-ai transport model (`Editor-Version`, `Editor-Plugin-Version`, and
`Copilot-Integration-Id`) even though runtime models use the local row id for
account isolation. Agent-runtime supplies Copilot's context-sensitive request
headers per call; a saved custom header with the same name overrides the
default.

### Copy a provider into an independent draft

Model configuration offers **Copy** on ordinary non-OAuth provider rows. The
action normally opens a new custom-service draft with an editable API format,
allowing the same endpoint and model bindings to be reused for another
protocol. OpenCode Go is the exception: its copy retains the named service and
fixed `opencode_go` format; selecting Custom service first makes the ordinary
API formats editable. OAuth account rows do not offer this action.

The draft is built from an explicit allowlist: the source name, `baseUrl`,
`apiStyle`, and declared `models` binding fields. Model objects and nested
`thinkingLevels` arrays are copied independently so draft edits cannot mutate
the source. A copy label may distinguish the suggested name; the user can edit
it before saving. No source `id`, credential or credential reference,
`hasSecret` state, OAuth metadata, custom `headers`, or unknown fields are
copied. All custom headers are omitted because an otherwise permitted header
may contain a token. The dialog explains that credentials and custom headers
must be supplied again when needed.

A malformed Base URL, a non-HTTP(S) scheme, or a URL containing user info,
query parameters, or a fragment is left blank in the draft so legacy URL
credentials are not copied.

The draft uses the normal new-provider discovery path: it must not pass the
source provider id to model discovery or connection testing to resolve that
provider's stored key. Any authenticated discovery uses only credentials
explicitly supplied for the new draft. Copying does not read or duplicate
secret-store values.

Canceling the draft performs no provider/configuration persistence. Saving
uses the existing `createProvider` / `providers.create` flow and assigns a new
provider identity and, when a new key is entered, that provider's own secret
reference. The source provider and global default provider/model selections
remain unchanged. The first selected model remains the new provider's own
default through the existing create behavior. Copying adds no IPC method,
storage schema, or permission boundary.

## 3. Built-in vendor presets

Presets only prefill form defaults; they are not a closed world.

| vendorKey | default protocol | authKind | baseUrl required |
|---|---|---|---|
| openai | openai | api_key | no |
| anthropic | anthropic | api_key | no |
| google | google | api_key | no |
| openrouter | openai_compatible | api_key_and_base_url | yes |
| deepseek | openai_compatible | api_key_and_base_url | yes |
| groq | openai_compatible | api_key_and_base_url | yes |
| together | openai_compatible | api_key_and_base_url | yes |
| fireworks | openai_compatible | api_key_and_base_url | yes |
| mistral | openai_compatible or native | api_key | optional |
| xai | openai_compatible | api_key_and_base_url | yes |
| azure_openai | openai_compatible | azure_api_key | yes |
| bedrock | bedrock | aws_sdk_default | no |
| ollama | openai_compatible | none | yes |
| lmstudio | openai_compatible | none | yes |
| custom | openai_compatible | api_key_and_base_url | yes |

### Fixed API-style presets

| apiStyle | provider type | authKind | name | baseUrl |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `opencode_go` | `openai_compatible` | `api_key_and_base_url` | `OpenCode Go` | `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1` |

### Named endpoint presets

These rows are created from the add-provider **Service** select, not from a
new protocol. They remain `type: "openai_compatible"`. The common path is
Service + API key; the published host is a summary, and the display name is
editable in Advanced. Custom endpoint shows Name beside Base URL, then API key
beside API format. `vendorKey` is the models.dev provider key.

International: OpenAI (`responses`), Anthropic (`anthropic_messages`), Google
Gemini (`google_generative_ai`), OpenRouter, Groq, xAI, Mistral, Together AI,
Fireworks, OpenCode Go (`opencode_go`), Z.AI / Z.AI Coding Plan.

China: DeepSeek, Qwen DashScope (`alibaba-cn`), Moonshot (`moonshotai-cn`),
Zhipu AI / Coding Plan, SiliconFlow (`siliconflow-cn`), Volcengine Ark,
MiniMax (`anthropic_messages` at `https://api.minimaxi.com/anthropic/v1`),
MiniMax (OpenAI) (`chat_completions` at `https://api.minimaxi.com/v1`, aliases
`minimax-openai` / `minimax-compatible`), Kimi For Coding (`anthropic_messages`).

Zhipu / Z.AI Completions requests still receive `thinkingFormat: "zai"` and
`zaiToolStream: true`. pi-ai `zai-coding-cn` remains an alias of
`zhipuai-coding-plan`. DeepSeek-family Completions requests receive
`requiresReasoningContentOnAssistantMessages: true` when the vendor key, URL,
model id, or catalog family identifies DeepSeek. `thinkingFormat` is unchanged.

### Vendor-account presets

These rows are created by signing in (Settings -> Model configuration ->
Vendor accounts), not by the custom-provider dialog. The list is derived at
runtime from `models.getProviders().filter(p => p.auth.oauth)`, so it tracks
pi-ai rather than this table; every login creates a separate row, and
`baseUrl`, `apiStyle`, and `defaultModelId` are filled in from that account's
own catalog after login. Matching models.dev records provide the binding
metadata; an account model absent from the snapshot remains generic.

| vendorKey | subscription | typical apiStyle | login shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| anthropic | Claude Pro/Max | anthropic_messages | PKCE + local callback |
| openai-codex | ChatGPT Plus/Pro | openai_codex_responses | PKCE + local callback, or pasted code |
| github-copilot | Copilot | varies by model | device code |
| openrouter | account credit | chat_completions | PKCE + local callback |
| kimi-coding | Kimi | chat_completions (headers-only auth) | device code |
| xai | xAI | chat_completions | device code |
| radius | Radius | pi_messages | PKCE + local callback |

## 4. Model catalog cache record

```ts
type ModelCatalogCacheRecord = {
  providerId?: string // empty for global bundled
  modelId: string
  displayName: string
  vendorKey: string
  capabilities: string[]
  contextWindow?: number
  source: "bundled" | "discovered" | "user"
  /** Renderer annotation for a row resolved from the bundled models.dev snapshot. */
  catalogSource?: "models.dev"
  updatedAt: string
  raw?: unknown
}
```

## 5. Bundled models.dev snapshot

The raw public catalog is checked into the release resource at
`apps/desktop/resources/models.dev/api.json` and packaged at
`resources/models.dev/api.json`. `scripts/release.mjs` fetches and validates
`https://models.dev/api.json`, then atomically replaces the checked-in file
before creating a release tag. Electron main reads this bundled snapshot at
startup without network I/O. Settings → Model configuration can refetch the
URL, but a successful response updates only the current process's in-memory
catalog; it never writes the packaged resource or a user cache. Cache reads
never send provider credentials to models.dev. The Rust `models` table continues
to store only normalized provider selection rows; it does not need a schema
change for the raw snapshot.

## 6. IPC / host methods (provider domain)

- `providers.list`
- `providers.get`
- `providers.create`
- `providers.update`
- `providers.delete`
- `providers.testConnection`
- `providers.listModels`
- `providers.cacheModels` (internal Electron-main to host persistence bridge)
- `providers.refreshModels`
- `providers.upsertUserModel`
- `providers.deleteUserModel`

## 6. Security constraints

1. raw secrets never returned by list/get provider APIs
2. `headers` must not store `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` if secret store can be used
3. export settings excludes secrets by default

## 7. Migration

- schema version via `PRAGMA user_version` (04-data-storage §7)
- provider records additive-evolved; per-provider extension fields land in `config_json`
- unknown future protocol values should not crash older app versions (ignore/disable with warning)
- an unknown or legacy `apiStyle` remains editable: the provider editor uses
  `chat_completions` as its safe UI fallback, and a subsequent save repairs the
  stored style instead of crashing while normalizing the base URL

## 8. SQL (Rust-owned SQLite)

The canonical DDL lives in [04-data-storage](04-data-storage.md) (D086). Summary of the provider-domain tables:

```sql
-- providers: id/name/vendor_key/type/protocol/api_style/auth_kind/base_url/
--            enabled/secret_ref/default_model_id + config_json (headers,
--            compatibility, future knobs), INTEGER ms timestamps
-- models:    PK(provider_id, model_id), display_name, source
--            (bundled|discovered|user), capabilities_json, context_window,
--            max_output_tokens, deprecated — refresh upserts never overwrite
--            source='user' rows
-- secrets_meta: secret_ref PK, owner_kind/owner_id, kind, backend
```

> Raw secret material is **not** stored in these tables.

## 9. Host method contracts (v1)

### `providers.list`
- in: `{ includeDisabled?: boolean }`
- out: `{ providers: ProviderPublic[] }`
- `ProviderPublic` excludes raw secrets; includes `hasSecret: boolean` (true
  for **either** credential), `hasOauth: boolean`, the non-secret
  `oauthAccountLabel?: string`, and optional `headers?: Record<string, string>`

### `providers.create` / `providers.update`
- in: provider fields + optional `secretValue` + optional `oauthAccountLabel`
  (merged into `config_json.oauth`, cleared with an empty string) + optional
  `headers` (merged into `config_json.headers`, cleared with `{}`); leftover
  `config_json.userAgent` migrates into `headers["User-Agent"]` on read; legacy
  clients may still send `supportsReasoning` / `supportedThinkingLevels`; new
  clients send `models: ModelBinding[]`
- behavior: persist config; if secretValue present, write secret store and set
  `secretRef`; legacy thinking fields may remain in
  `config_json.compatibility` but do not affect runtime resolution
- out: `ProviderPublic`

### `providers.delete`
- in: `{ id, deleteSecret?: boolean }` default `deleteSecret=true`
- behavior: clears both credential refs (`:api_key` and `:oauth`) and their
  metadata rows, so a re-created provider can never inherit a stranger's
  refresh token. The renderer uses this same operation for removing one OAuth
  account, so deleting one row cannot remove another account with the same
  `vendorKey`
- out: `{ ok: true }`

### `providers.testConnection`
- in: `{ id, modelId?: string }`
- out: `{ ok: boolean, latencyMs?: number, error?: AppError, sampleModelId?: string }`
- an `authKind: "oauth"` row proves itself by resolving vendor auth (refreshing
  the token if it expired) instead of probing the network with a key it does
  not have

### `providers.listModels`
- renderer IPC in: `{ providerId, source?: "cache"|"refresh" }`; `cache`
  returns the durable catalog without provider network access, while `refresh`
  reads the local models.dev snapshot and runs provider endpoint discovery only for IDs absent from it
- host RPC in: `{ providerId?: string }`; reads only the Rust-owned `models`
  table
- for an `authKind: "oauth"` row Electron main reads the authenticated catalog
  (`models.getAvailable`, which applies the vendor's own `filterModels`, so a
  Copilot account lists what its subscription includes) instead of calling
  `/models`; each returned model carries the apiStyle its wire API implies.
  Static vendors such as `openai-codex` use the pinned pi-ai catalog (0.85.1
  includes `gpt-6-astra`); models.dev does not invent those IDs.
- out: `{ models: ModelCatalogItem[] }`; each known model carries the complete
  models.dev metadata including `reasoning`, `supportedThinkingLevels`, limits,
  modalities, output types, and capability tags. Cached/provider claims cannot
  override the local catalog record.

### `providers.cacheModels` (internal host RPC)
- in: `{ providerId, models: DiscoveredModelInput[] }`
- behavior: transactionally upsert successful live discovery into `models` as
  `source='discovered'`; never overwrite `source='user'` rows and never delete
  prior cache rows on a failed or partial refresh
- out: `{ cached: number, models: ModelCatalogItem[] }`
- raw secrets and authorization headers are never part of this call

### `providers.refreshModels`
- in: `{ id }`
- out: `{ added: number, updated: number, removed: number, models: ModelCatalogItem[] }`

### `providers.upsertUserModel` / `providers.deleteUserModel`
- manage free-form / override model entries

## 10. Validation rules

1. API/custom `name` unique (case-insensitive) among editable providers;
   OAuth rows may share a vendor display name because `providerId` is their
   account identity
2. `openai_compatible` / local gateways require absolute `baseUrl` unless preset says optional
3. `apiStyle=opencode_go` requires the fixed OpenCode Go name and endpoint; clients must not accept overrides
4. `authKind=none` forbidden for cloud presets that require keys
5. headers keys are case-insensitive unique, at most 32 entries; names
   alphanumeric plus hyphen; values trimmed, at most 4096 bytes, no CR/LF
6. reserved header names (`authorization`, `host`, `content-type`,
   `x-api-key`, `x-opencode-session`, and the rest listed above) are rejected
7. secretValue max length enforced (e.g. 8KB)
8. modelId must be non-empty trimmed string; allow `/`, `.`, `:`, `-`
9. unknown protocol on older clients => provider shown disabled with warning, not crash
10. Legacy `supportsReasoning`, when present, must still validate as boolean but
   has no runtime effect
11. Legacy `supportedThinkingLevels`, when present, must still validate as an
  array of canonical thinking levels but has no runtime effect

## 11. Secret ref format

```text
secret:provider:<providerId>:api_key
secret:provider:<providerId>:oauth
```

The two refs are independent, so one row may hold a key, a vendor account, or
both; see [14-secrets-storage](14-secrets-storage.md) §10. Future multi-secret
providers may add further suffixes (`:client_secret`, etc.).
