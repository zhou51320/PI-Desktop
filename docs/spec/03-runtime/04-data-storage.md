# 04. Data Storage (Schema v16)

## 0. Ownership decision

**Rust host-core owns SQLite exclusively (D002), and the transcript file
store with it (D119). Plan/Goal artifacts and queue records are also host-owned
(D189); shell defaults are host settings (D190).**

- Node pi sidecar does not open the DB or transcript files directly
- Electron main does not write DB or transcript files directly
- All persistent app data — sessions, settings, providers, scheduled tasks,
  artifacts, notifications, audit — goes through host RPC. (v1 violation
  fixed: scheduled tasks previously lived in an Electron-owned
  `scheduled-tasks.json`.)

## 1. Goals

Local-first, recoverable after restart, sensitive data isolated — plus, for
schema v7, v8, v11, and v14:

1. **Lossless transcripts** — store the runtime message shape (content blocks),
   not the UI projection; UI shapes are derived at the RPC boundary.
2. **SQLite is an index, not a payload store (D119)** — message content lives
   in one JSONL file per session (codex/claude-code style): human-readable,
   greppable, copyable, and the database stays small no matter how much is
   chatted.
3. **High performance** — O(1) file appends, covering indexes for every hot
   query, integer times, single-writer WAL, no JSON scans on hot paths, and
   bounded renderer transcript reads even when a session contains very large
   message content.
4. **Extensible without migrations** where cheap (block vocabulary, JSONL line
   types, kv namespaces, `config_json` columns), **with migrations** where
   structural (new entities), versioned by `PRAGMA user_version`.

Project groups use the existing `kv` extension boundary rather than a new
relational schema. The host stores one JSON record per group in the
`projectGroups` namespace, shared memory in `projectGroupMemory`, and shared
instructions in `projectGroupInstructions`. The record contains the stable group
id, display name, ordered canonical roots, primary root, timestamps, and optional
`detachedPaths`. Removed roots stay in `detachedPaths` so an old path project
record is not recreated as a standalone legacy group; sessions and files are not
deleted. Existing path projects are projected as legacy single-root groups at
read time; their path-scoped memory and filesystem instructions remain readable.
5. **Plan/Goal checkpoints are immutable host artifacts** with recorded path,
   hash, and size; the existing approval row also carries execution fields.
   Startup interruption is the process-epoch fence and no work is replayed.

## 2. File layout

```

One database file keeps cross-entity writes transactional (e.g. session +
turn + artifact in one commit). The DB stores **no large payloads**: message
content lives in `sessions/`, attachments and tool outputs beyond the limits
of [16-tool-result-limits](16-tool-result-limits.md) live on disk, referenced
by path/hash.

### 2.0 Message-owned review snapshots (ADR 0043)

Successful workspace `Write`/`Edit` tool results carry the bounded
`details.review` record described in [03-tools-and-permissions](03-tools-and-permissions.md).
The transcript JSONL is the durable index for the visible card; the previous
bytes and hashes live outside the workspace in
`review-changes/<sessionId>/<snapshotId>/`. The host removes a session's
snapshot directory with `session.delete` and sweeps directories whose session
no longer exists at startup. A snapshot is never inferred from Git, so a later
commit does not remove historical review evidence.

### 2.1 Transcript files (D119)

`sessions/<sessionId>.jsonl` — first line is a session header, then one line
per message; `seq` is implied by line order:

```jsonl
{"type":"session","schema":1,"sessionId":"0b0e…","createdAt":"2026-07-26T09:00:00.000Z"}
{"type":"message","id":"m1","role":"user","createdAt":"…","blocks":[{"type":"text","text":"…"}]}
{"type":"message","id":"m2","role":"tool","toolName":"Write","blocks":[{"type":"tool_call","callId":"c1","args":{},"result":{},"status":"success"}]}
{"type":"message","id":"m3","role":"assistant","createdAt":"…","blocks":[{"type":"thinking","text":"…"},{"type":"text","text":"…"}],"meta":{"usage":{},"modelId":"…"}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"cp1","summary":"…","firstKeptMessageId":"m2","throughMessageId":"m3","tokensBefore":917000,"retainedTail":[…],"providerId":"…","modelId":"…","createdAt":"…"}
```

`sessions/<sessionId>.inflight.json` — the assistant reply currently
streaming in the session, as one `{ schema, sessionId, turnId, savedAt,
message }` object that host-core replaces atomically (temp + rename) on every
`session.saveInflightMessage` (D299). Electron main sends a checkpoint at most
every 1.5 s while `message_update` events carry visible text, so a quit or
crash mid-reply loses at most the last interval of output instead of the whole
reply. The file is transient: the final row's `session.appendMessage` with the
same id removes it; a `completed`/`error` turn end removes it only when that
id is already indexed (D327); and the boot sweep plus a sidecar-loss turn
end (`recoverInflight`) promote a leftover whose final row never landed —
as `complete` when the turn already completed, otherwise as an `aborted`
assistant message under its turn. It is never appended to, never read by the sidecar, and never
mirrored into SQLite; a late checkpoint for an id that is already indexed is
dropped. Delegate replies are not checkpointed.

`sessions/<sessionId>.revisions.jsonl` — append-only, one line per archived
regenerate branch; the *active* flag lives only in the DB index so switching
revisions never rewrites this file:

```jsonl
{"type":"revision","rootUserId":"u1","revisionIndex":1,"createdAt":"…","messages":[…message records…],"turns":{"<messageId>":"<turnId>"}}
```

Rules:

- `blocks` is the canonical block vocabulary (§4.7) — not the UiMessage
  projection. `meta` is the parsed metadata object (usage / modelId /
  providerId / status / error / revision fields).
- Timestamps in files are RFC3339 wire spellings (readability); the DB index
  keeps integer ms.
- Readers skip unknown `type` lines and a torn trailing line: new line kinds
  need no migration, and a crash mid-append cannot poison the file.
- `compaction` is a model-context checkpoint, not a message — but it is
  rendered, as a divider row rather than a chat bubble (D203). Readers return
  every message unchanged and separately return **every** still-valid
  checkpoint, oldest first; the newest is the active one and the whole chain is
  what the transcript draws its rows from, so a checkpoint outlives the
  compaction that produced it. A record whose `throughMessageId` anchor no
  longer exists is dropped, per record, on read and on fork.
  `throughMessageId` is the durable transcript boundary;
  `firstKeptMessageId` and `retainedTail` reproduce the summary + applicable
  context after restart. `retainedTail` holds at most the latest user message
  for an active turn; a completed-turn checkpoint has an empty tail. The
  `details.retainedTailMode` value (`active_turn` or `completed_turn`) preserves
  that boundary, while legacy records are normalized to their latest user
  message. If the active message crossed the retention limit it is stored in
  marked, truncated form; the original message lines stay complete and
  authoritative for UI/diagnostics. An automatic compaction failure may store
  `details.fallback = "retained_tail"` and a short recovery summary instead of
  an LLM-generated summary; the complete transcript remains authoritative and
  the fallback tail is only a model-context recovery view. `details` also
  carries the checkpoint generation and the compaction family, both opaque to
  the host.
- Writers append with flush + fsync (message durability ≈ WAL
  `synchronous=NORMAL`); full transcript rewrites (regenerate/edit, revision
  switch, import) go through a sibling temp file + atomic rename. A normal
  context checkpoint is one appended line and never rewrites visible messages.
  A rewrite carries forward every checkpoint that is still valid against the
  rewritten messages, not just the newest one.
- Ordering: the file is written **before** the DB index transaction. A crash
  between the two costs one derived index row — never content — and the next
  full rewrite self-heals; transcript reads dedupe repeated message ids
  keep-last.
- Transcript files are user data: removed only when their session is deleted,
  never by an age or orphan sweep (unlike `scratch/`).

## 3. Connection bootstrap

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;      -- durable enough under WAL; app-crash safe
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;
PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;
PRAGMA cache_size = -16000;       -- 16 MB page cache
PRAGMA trusted_schema = ON;       -- required by the FTS triggers (§4.8); the DB
                                  -- is app-owned at a fixed path, never an
                                  -- untrusted input, so schema trust is safe
PRAGMA auto_vacuum = INCREMENTAL; -- set at creation, before any table
```

- Schema version lives in `PRAGMA user_version` (v15 = `15`). The v1 `meta`
  table is gone.
- host-core is the **single writer**; statements use `prepare_cached`; every
  multi-row write runs in one transaction.
- Boot maintenance runs before RPC service: one transaction marks every
  `plan_approvals` row with `status='pending'` as `interrupted` and every row
  with `execution_state IN ('queued', 'running')` as `interrupted`; it also
  aborts running turns and appends the recovery audit records. No process epoch
is serialized. An already-approved queued/running Plan/Goal interruption leaves
  `sessions.mode = 'agent'`. The transaction then proceeds to the normal
  `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum` and audit retention pruning (§9).

## 4. Schema

### 4.1 kv — namespaced configuration

Replaces v1 `settings` + `meta`, and hosts plugin settings (spec 07-11 §5).

```sql
CREATE TABLE kv (
  ns         TEXT NOT NULL,
  key        TEXT NOT NULL,
  value_json TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (ns, key)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

| ns | contents |
|---|---|
| `app` | the settings blob (`settings.get/set`), `currentProjectId`. Optional `networkProxy` (`mode`/`url`/`bypass`) is a JSON field in that blob; no schema version bump (D340) |
| `ui` | non-critical UI state the renderer asks the host to keep |
| `cache` | model-refresh stamps, recent model refs (spec 13 §3) |
| `plugin:<id>` | per-plugin settings; uninstall = `DELETE WHERE ns = ?` |
| `projectMemory` | durable user-authored context keyed by canonical project path; structured values contain `format: "entries-v1"`, visual `entries`, derived `content`, and `updatedAt` |

New config domains (e.g. MCP servers) start as a namespace; they graduate to
tables only when they need relations or indexes.

#### Renderer sidebar preferences (D093)

Sidebar organization is non-authoritative presentation state stored
best-effort under renderer localStorage key
`pi.desktop.sidebarPreferences`:

```ts
type SidebarPreferences = {
  sessionMeta: Record<string, {
    pinned?: boolean;
    archived?: boolean;
    order?: number; // renderer-local manual order
  }>;
  projectMeta: Record<string, {
    pinned?: boolean;
    archived?: boolean;
    collapsed?: boolean;
    order?: number; // renderer-local manual order
  }>;
  projectSort: "recent" | "created" | "oldest" | "name" | "manual";
  sessionView: {
    sort: "recent" | "created" | "oldest" | "name" | "manual";
    archived: boolean;
  };
  openProjectPaths: string[];
};
```

- Project keys and retained paths use normalized full paths; session keys use
  durable session ids. Duplicate/slash-variant paths are discarded on load.
- `projectSort: "manual"` and `projectMeta[*].order` store renderer-local
  project presentation order. Dragging a project title or using ArrowUp
  and ArrowDown on that title writes contiguous order values for the visible normalized paths.
  Missing or invalid values fall back to stable path order; pinned and archived
  priority remains applied before manual order. Session `manual`/`order` remain
  compatibility fields and are not exposed by the sidebar.
- Missing, malformed, or unwritable preferences fall back to empty metadata,
  `recent`, archived hidden, and the host-selected project. Preference failure
  never blocks a host operation.
- The record never contains transcript content, tool arguments, provider
  configuration, or secrets. Clearing it changes presentation only.
- `openProjectPaths` retains sidebar tabs. The selected workspace remains
  host-owned `kv(app, currentProjectId)` and is restored through
  `workspace.get`; the renderer does not persist a competing active path.

### 4.2 projects — places work happens

Replaces the v1 `workspace` singleton. Feeds the Settings Project archive index
(D066/D133), sidebar group-by-project (benchmark §3.8), and future per-project
defaults.

```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id             INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  path           TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  name           TEXT NOT NULL,
  pinned         INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at     INTEGER NOT NULL,
  last_opened_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

- Rows are auto-upserted by path whenever a workspace is opened, a session is
  created with a project path, or an import references one.
- Project paths are trimmed, separators are normalized to `/`, and trailing
  separators are removed before the unique-path upsert. Imports therefore
  materialize one durable logical project directory per distinct path.
- `projects.list` is the Project archive index source of truth. Renderer
  preferences may hide an archived project from the default sidebar, but cannot
  remove or hide its durable Projects-index row.
- A project row is a logical index entry. Import never creates an operating
  system directory: historical paths may be missing, remote, or read-only.
- The *current* visible workspace is `kv(app, currentProjectId)` — no singleton
  table, no partial-unique flag. Retained tabs do not add more current-project
  fields.
- Project memory is host-owned in `kv(ns='projectMemory', key=<canonical path>)`
  rather than renderer preferences. It is independent for every project path,
  capped at 32 KiB, and is loaded by Electron main when a project session
  starts. Visual entries are normalized and rendered to plain `content` for
  the runtime; legacy plain-text values remain readable and are shown as one
  untitled entry when opened in the editor. The runtime labels it as
  user-provided context so it cannot become a replacement for safety, tool, or
  collaboration rules.

### 4.3 providers

Same role as v1; `headers_json` + `compatibility_json` collapse into one
extensible `config_json` (shape per [12-provider-config-schema](12-provider-config-schema.md)).

```sql
CREATE TABLE providers (
  id               TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name             TEXT NOT NULL,
  vendor_key       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'custom',
  type             TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'openai_compatible',
  protocol         TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'openai_compatible',
  api_style        TEXT,
  auth_kind        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'api_key_and_base_url',
  base_url         TEXT,
  enabled          INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  secret_ref       TEXT,
  default_model_id TEXT,
  config_json      TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at       INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at       INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

### 4.4 models — catalog cache

Implements [13-model-catalog-and-selection](13-model-catalog-and-selection.md)
(v1's dead `provider_models` never did).

```sql
CREATE TABLE models (
  provider_id       TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES providers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  model_id          TEXT NOT NULL,
  display_name      TEXT NOT NULL,
  source            TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user',  -- bundled | discovered | user
  capabilities_json TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',
  context_window    INTEGER,
  max_output_tokens INTEGER,
  deprecated        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at        INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (provider_id, model_id)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

Refresh (spec 13 §6/§9) upserts `discovered` rows and **never overwrites
`source='user'`** rows. Recent-model MRU stays in `kv(cache)` — it is a
bounded display list, not relational data.

### 4.5 sessions

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  project_id  INTEGER REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  provider_id TEXT,                            -- loose ref, see below
  model_id    TEXT,
  mode        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'agent',   -- plan | agent
  thinking_level TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'off'
                CHECK (thinking_level IN ('off', 'minimal', 'low', 'medium',
                                          'high', 'xhigh', 'max')),
  permission_mode TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'inherit' -- D115: inherit follows settings
                CHECK (permission_mode IN ('inherit', 'ask', 'accept-edits', 'auto')),
  source      TEXT,                            -- import origin: claude-code | codex | opencode | pi
  deleted_at  INTEGER,                         -- plugin trash marker; null means active
  pinned      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  last_seq    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,      -- current message count / ordinal allocator
  created_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_updated ON sessions(updated_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_project ON sessions(project_id) WHERE project_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_deleted ON sessions(deleted_at) WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
```

Plugin imports add a host-owned origin sidecar. It is deliberately separate
from the core session identity and scopes every plugin read/write to the
`plugin_id` that created the row:

```sql
CREATE TABLE session_import_origins (
  plugin_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
  source_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
  external_id  TEXT NOT NULL,
  session_id   TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  source_label TEXT,
  origin_json  TEXT,
  created_at   INTEGER NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(plugin_id, source_id, external_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_session_import_origins_plugin
  ON session_import_origins(plugin_id, source_id, created_at DESC);
```

- `provider_id`/`model_id` are **loose references** (no FK), like on `turns`:
  selection is `(providerId, modelId)` per spec 13 with custom ids always
  allowed, and built-in runtimes (e.g. `pi`) never exist in `providers`.
- `thinking_level` is the durable session selector. New and v2-migrated
  sessions default to `off`; capability resolution may clamp the effective
  request without rewriting the stored preference.

- `project_id` normalizes v1's free-text `project_path` (grouping, badges,
  hover-`+` new-session-in-project all become indexed lookups).
- `last_seq` is exposed as `SessionSummary.messageCount`. Appends allocate the
  next ordinal and full transcript rewrites reseat it to the current message
  count, so zero is the durable empty-session predicate.
- `title` is user-visible session metadata. The `session.rename` boundary trims
  and validates it to 1–80 Unicode code points before persisting it. A manual
  rename does not update `updated_at`, so changing a label cannot reorder
  recent activity; transcript rows, message count, and session state remain
  unchanged.
- Import binds every non-empty normalized `projectPath` to `project_id`;
  path-less imports remain `NULL`. Re-importing a deterministic session id
  creates neither another session nor another project row.
- The schema `pinned` column is retained for project-index ordering and
  migration compatibility. D093 sidebar pin/archive/collapse state is the
  renderer preference overlay and does not require a schema migration. No
  `status` column: live running/waiting state is runtime truth, not durable
  truth; badge data comes from the latest `turns` row (§4.6) plus in-memory
  state.
- `source` + deterministic imported ids keep re-imports idempotent and let the
  UI badge imported sessions.
- `deleted_at` is a host timestamp used by the plugin `trash` operation. A
  trashed plugin session is hidden from normal session lists and plugin reads,
  but its transcript and origin remain until the owning plugin purges it. Core
  session deletion cascades the sidecar; purging also removes transcript files.
- `session_import_origins` stores the plugin/source/external idempotency key and
  the original `projectPath`, `modelId`, and `providerId` as history JSON. Those
  values never become active session bindings for plugin imports. A plugin may
  explicitly supply a host-created `projectId`; only that id becomes the active
  `project_id`, while the historical fields remain unchanged.
- `project_id` is also the tool-root authority for that session. Switching the
  visible workspace cannot redirect an in-flight or later tool call belonging
  to a different session.
- Forking a session copies its current active transcript into a new session
  row while retaining the exact `project_id`, provider/model, mode, thinking,
  and permission configuration. No parent/child column is stored: the result
  is an independent session, not a durable navigation tree.
- `mode` is the authoritative operating mode. `plan` and `goal` mean the same pi
  Agent is negotiating a contract of that kind; neither ever selects another
  runtime. A live `pending` row
  in `plan_approvals` projects `awaiting_approval`; `execution_state` values
  `queued`/`running` project post-approval execution. Otherwise a Plan or Goal
  session is `planning` when its
  Agent is active or ready. The row's `kind` is what tells the two apart, since
  the projected state is shared. Terminal approval rows are historical
  durable records, not renderer gates; reject, expiry, or pending interruption
  returns live planning to editable state. The renderer may retain the latest
  proposal/execution snapshot per session only for its current lifetime from
  live Host events; `plans.pending` rehydrates only pending rows.
- New sessions default to `agent`. Imported legacy `chat` values are normalized
  to `plan`; forked sessions copy the durable mode but never copy pending,
  queued, or running approval rows.
- A message-scoped fork copies only the canonical prefix through the selected
  message. Assistant Edit uses that child and records the original/edited
  response tails in the child's existing `message_revisions` store; the source
  transcript and source revisions are never rewritten.

### 4.6 turns — one row per agent run

The persistence half of [10-session-state-machine](10-session-state-machine.md)
(`turn_runs` in the old logical model), and the rollup point for usage/cost.

```sql
CREATE TABLE turns (
  id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id    TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'running', -- running | completed | aborted | error
  provider_id   TEXT,                            -- snapshot at run time, no FK
  model_id      TEXT,                            -- snapshot at run time
  error_code    TEXT,
  input_tokens  INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  output_tokens INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  usage_json    TEXT,                            -- full provider usage (cached breakdown, …)
  started_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  ended_at      INTEGER
);
CREATE INDEX idx_turns_session ON turns(session_id, started_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_turns_ended_at ON turns(ended_at DESC);
```

### 4.6a plan_approvals — immutable checkpoint and execution fields (schema v11)

The host writes each submitted Markdown snapshot to a new unique file under the
proposal kind's directory: `<workspaceRoot>/.pi/plan/` for a plan and
`<workspaceRoot>/.pi/goal/` for a goal. The existing `plan_approvals` row stores
the kind, the structured title/question, artifact metadata, and post-approval
execution descriptor. The file path is relative to the session workspace and
always has the form `.pi/<kind>/<unique-name>.md`. One table serves both kinds
(D198), so the single-pending-approval invariant, the execution queue, and every
index are shared rather than duplicated.

```sql
CREATE TABLE plan_approvals (
  request_id               TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id               TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  turn_id                  TEXT NOT NULL,
  tool_call_id             TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  kind                     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'plan'
                             CHECK (kind IN ('plan', 'goal')),
  plan_json                TEXT NOT NULL, -- exact submitted Markdown snapshot
  title                    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  question                 TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  status                   TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN (
    'pending', 'approved', 'changes_requested', 'rejected',
    'expired', 'interrupted'

```

`plan_json` is the exact Markdown snapshot kept for the approval/execution
record; it is not a canonical wrapper. `title` and `question` are separate
structured fields. Each artifact file is immutable and unique, so a later
Plan/Goal turn creates a new complete snapshot/approval row and never replaces an
earlier file. Hash and byte size authenticate the file before approval, but the
approval UI may simply open the relative path.

Approval changes `status` to `approved`, sets `execution_id` and
`execution_state = 'queued'`, updates `sessions.mode` to `agent`, and stores
the explicit permission mode in one transaction. Reject/expiry leave the
session in its contract mode — Plan stays Plan and Goal stays Goal — and close
the active gate; a later prompt can create a new pending row. The new protocol
has no request-changes action; compatibility columns remain for older records.

At startup, before serving RPC, one transaction changes every `pending` row to
`interrupted` and every `queued` or `running` execution state to `interrupted`.
The associated running turn is aborted. There is no serialized process-epoch
column and no replay. A pending interruption leaves the session in its contract
mode, while an already-approved queued/running interruption leaves it Agent.
Renderer reload
within the same host can list the pending row and its original `expires_at`;
`plans.pending` returns no terminal rows, so rejected, expired, approved,
completed, and interrupted cards are not rehydrated.

Serves: mid-session model switches ("next turn only", spec 13 §4), the
per-message cost chip's session rollup (benchmark §3.2), failed/aborted badges
(§3.8), and retry lineage.

### 4.6b turn_queue — Host-owned turn queue (schema v15)

```sql
CREATE TABLE turn_queue (
  id               TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id       TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  principal        TEXT NOT NULL,
  idempotency_key  TEXT,
  input_hash       TEXT NOT NULL,
  content          TEXT NOT NULL,
  attachments_json TEXT,
  permission_mode  TEXT NOT NULL,
  position         INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at       INTEGER NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX idx_turn_queue_session ON turn_queue(session_id, position);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_turn_queue_idempotency
  ON turn_queue(session_id, principal, idempotency_key)
  WHERE idempotency_key IS NOT NULL;
```

- One row per prompt admitted behind an active turn (D375 / ADR 0213). The
  headless Agent Host module is the only writer through `session.queuePush`,
  `session.queueList`, and `session.queueRemove`; the store never starts a
  turn.
- `position` is per session and only grows, so a removed entry never
  reorders the rest. `principal` plus `idempotency_key` make a retried push
  return the same row; a reused key with a different `input_hash` fails with
  `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. A session holds at most eight entries.
- `attachments_json` keeps the prompt's attachment references; bytes stay in
  the session scratch or project root like any other prompt attachment.
- After a restart the module lists every entry, holds each session's queue
  until a controller attaches, and drains one entry after the active turn's
  terminal event. Deleting the session cascades to its entries.

### 4.6c session collaboration ledger — Host-owned delivery state (schema v16)

```sql
CREATE TABLE session_collaboration_links (
  session_id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_by_session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  plugin_id             TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at            INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE session_collaboration_messages (
  id                    TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  plugin_id             TEXT NOT NULL,
  source_session_id     TEXT NOT NULL,
  source_title          TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_session_id     TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  target_title          TEXT NOT NULL,
  kind                  TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(kind IN ('task', 'message', 'completion')),
  content               TEXT NOT NULL,
  status                TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(status IN
    ('queued', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled', 'interrupted')),
  notify_on_completion  INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  turn_id               TEXT REFERENCES turns(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  reply_to_message_id   TEXT,
  idempotency_key       TEXT NOT NULL,
  remaining_hops        INTEGER NOT NULL,
  permission_ceiling    TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(permission_ceiling IN
    ('ask', 'accept-edits', 'auto')),
  result                TEXT,
  error                 TEXT,
  created_at            INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at            INTEGER NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(plugin_id, source_session_id, idempotency_key)
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_session_collaboration_turn
  ON session_collaboration_messages(turn_id) WHERE turn_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_session_collaboration_receipt
  ON session_collaboration_messages(reply_to_message_id)
  WHERE kind = 'completion';
```

- The ledger is the authoritative identity and lifecycle record for a
  plugin-mediated delivery. `source_session_id` and `target_session_id` are
  real durable Session IDs; titles are display snapshots only. `turn_id` is
  assigned when the target actually begins the delivery, not when a plugin
  creates the record.
  `source_session_id` deliberately has no foreign key, unlike
  `target_session_id`, which cascades, so a delivery record and its completion
  receipt outlive a deleted sender. Read projections therefore report such
  references with `available: false` instead of dropping the row.
- `turn_queue.session_message_id` binds a queued Agent Host admission to its
  ledger row. A retry with the same `(plugin_id, source_session_id,
  idempotency_key)` returns the original delivery; changing its target, body,
  kind, or callback flag fails with `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.
- A callback is a `kind = 'completion'` row with
  `reply_to_message_id` pointing at the original delivery. The partial unique
  index and the host settlement transaction make callback creation
  at-most-once. Callback bodies contain a bounded result/error projection; the
  original target transcript remains the full source of truth.
- The host snapshots the sender's effective permission ceiling and rejects a
  target whose current effective mode exceeds it. Autonomous chains decrement
  `remaining_hops`; completion rows cannot create another automatic callback.
- On startup, queued work that still has a `turn_queue` row remains held for
  the Agent Host controller. Running work and queued deliveries without a
  queue admission are marked `interrupted`; the startup fence never replays a
  turn without a new controller admission.
- Collaboration provenance is stored in the transcript line's `meta` as
  `sessionMessage` and is projected to the UI as `UiMessage.sessionMessage`.
  Host validation prevents forged, stripped, edited, or regenerated
  collaboration input from becoming ordinary human input. This metadata is
  additive and does not require a column in `messages`.

### 4.7 messages — transcript index

The transcript itself is the per-session JSONL file (§2.1); this table is its
derived index: one row per message carrying ordering, promoted filter columns,
and the extracted plain text that feeds FTS. Tool calls are rows in the
stream (as today) with `text = NULL`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
  mid          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,             -- stable rowid: FTS anchor, VACUUM-safe
  id           TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,            -- caller-facing uuid (optimistic UI)
  session_id   TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  turn_id      TEXT REFERENCES turns(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  seq          INTEGER NOT NULL,                -- per-session ordinal
  role         TEXT NOT NULL,                   -- user | assistant | tool | system
  tool_name    TEXT,                            -- promoted for tool rows (filters, audit joins)
  is_error     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  text         TEXT,                            -- extracted plain text (search/preview); NULL for tool rows
  created_at   INTEGER NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE (session_id, seq)
);
```

**Block vocabulary** (open set — new types need no migration; stored in the
transcript file's `blocks` array):

```ts
type Block =
  | { type: "text"; text: string }
  | { type: "thinking"; text: string }
  | { type: "tool_call"; callId: string; name: string; args: unknown;
      status: "ok" | "error" | "denied"; result?: unknown;
      completedAt?: string; durationMs?: number;
      toolUsage?: ToolTokenUsage }
  | { type: "attachment"; kind: "image" | "file"; name: string;
      ref: string /* attachments/<sha256> or absolute path */;
      mimeType?: string; size?: number };
```

- Tool results are stored **post-truncation** (16-tool-result-limits); full
  raw output is not a storage concern.
- A user attachment block stores only kind, display name, MIME/size metadata,
  and a ref. Image bytes are content-addressed under `attachments/` before the
  turn is dispatched; transient base64 used to build a pi-ai
  image block never enters the transcript, database, or renderer message.
  Non-vision and oversized-image turns retain a safe scratch/project `@path`
  fallback for the model. Replayed content-store images use
  `scratch/<sessionId>/replayed/` when a path fallback is required. Images
  above the inline bound are hashed and copied with streaming file operations;
  startup and history hydration must not load the whole image into memory.
- Assistant thinking is stored only in `thinking` blocks inside the file. The
  derived `text` column contains final answer text, so transcript search and
  answer previews do not expose or mix reasoning.
- Per-response usage/model metadata rides in the file line's `meta` object;
  `turns` holds the summable rollup — no `json_each` at query time. Optional
  response stream duration and estimated tool token footprints are preserved
  with the message metadata so the context inspector survives reload.
- Ordering: `seq` is allocated O(1) inside the index transaction via
  `UPDATE sessions SET last_seq = last_seq + 1 … RETURNING last_seq`; the
  file's line order is the same ordering. `UNIQUE(session_id, seq)` doubles
  as the covering index for index scans; transcript *content* loads from the
  file, not this table.
- The index is derived state: losing a row (crash between file append and
  index commit) degrades search for that message until the next full rewrite,
  but never loses content.
- `mid` (explicit INTEGER PRIMARY KEY) pins rowids across `VACUUM`, which the
  FTS external-content mapping depends on; `id` stays the wire-format uuid.

### 4.7a Subagent attribution (D201, ADR 0062)

Rows a subagent produced are stored in the same transcript file and the same
index as the parent's; what marks them is two fields in the file line's `meta`
object, written by host-core when the sidecar sends them:

```ts
meta.parentToolCallId?: string  // the `Task` call that spawned the delegate
meta.agentName?: string         // the definition name, e.g. "code-reviewer"
```

No column, no table, no migration: attribution is metadata about a message, and
promoting it would buy a query nobody makes.

Both fields survive reload, which is what makes a restored session nest exactly
like a live one (`04-ux/08-component-spec.md` §9.9). Two consumers read them:

- The renderer groups attributed rows under their `Task` row and renders them
  one level in; the turn stream and the minimap never see them.
- The session runtime **excludes** attributed rows when it rebuilds model
  context on restore. The parent only ever saw the delegate's report, which is
  the `Task` tool result and is stored as such; replaying the delegate's own
  rows would both misrepresent the conversation and reintroduce the context cost
  delegation exists to avoid.

Retention and deletion treat them as ordinary rows: a deleted session takes its
delegate rows with it, and regenerate archives them with the branch they belong
to.

### 4.8 messages_fts — full-text search

Global search across transcripts (WorkBuddy-benchmark search, command
palette). Trigram tokenizer covers CJK and substring matches; queries shorter
than 3 chars fall back to `LIKE` on `messages.text`.

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE messages_fts USING fts5(
  text,
  content='messages', content_rowid='mid',
  tokenize='trigram'
);
CREATE TRIGGER messages_ai AFTER INSERT ON messages WHEN new.text IS NOT NULL
  BEGIN INSERT INTO messages_fts(rowid, text) VALUES (new.mid, new.text); END;
CREATE TRIGGER messages_ad AFTER DELETE ON messages WHEN old.text IS NOT NULL
  BEGIN INSERT INTO messages_fts(messages_fts, rowid, text)
        VALUES ('delete', old.mid, old.text); END;
CREATE TRIGGER messages_au AFTER UPDATE OF text ON messages
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO messages_fts(messages_fts, rowid, text)
      SELECT 'delete', old.mid, old.text WHERE old.text IS NOT NULL;
    INSERT INTO messages_fts(rowid, text)
      SELECT new.mid, new.text WHERE new.text IS NOT NULL;
  END;
```

Session titles are searched with a plain scan (sessions number in the
hundreds; no second FTS table). Index maintenance uses triggers rather than
application code so that **cascade deletes** (session → messages) clean the
index too; this is why `trusted_schema = ON` is part of the bootstrap. DDL
validated end-to-end (insert/update/delete/cascade + CJK trigram match) with
`sqlite3` 3.43+.

### 4.9 message_revisions — regenerate history index

Archives discarded regenerate branches so users can page previous variants
without stacking them in the live transcript (D105/D109). One row is one
linear branch rooted at a user turn; the branch **payload** lives in the
append-only `sessions/<id>.revisions.jsonl` (§2.1), keyed by
`(rootUserId, revisionIndex)`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE message_revisions (
  id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  root_user_id    TEXT NOT NULL,            -- wire id of the root user message
  revision_index  INTEGER NOT NULL,         -- 1-based per (session, root)
  is_active       INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  message_count   INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, -- pager label, no payload parse
  created_at      INTEGER NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE (session_id, root_user_id, revision_index)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_message_revisions_root
  ON message_revisions(session_id, root_user_id, revision_index);
```

- Live transcript remains the active branch only (transcript file + index).
- Switching a pager entry reads the branch from the revisions file, rewrites
  the live transcript file, rebuilds index rows, and flips `is_active` —
  the revisions file itself is never rewritten.
- Cascade on `session_id` clears index rows; file deletion rides on session
  deletion.
- `root_user_id` is the stable regenerate-family key. Live rewritten user
  prompts may carry a new message `id`, but `meta.revisionRootId` keeps
  pointing at the original family so later regenerates append to one set.
- Root user `meta` also stores `revisionCount` / `activeRevision` for the
  transcript pager; those fields are presentation metadata, not a second source
  of truth for branch payloads.
- The branch that finished a turn is archived by `session.saveActiveRevision`,
  which reads the transcript, appends the revision line, and stamps the root's
  pager metadata inside one host call. The stamp rewrites only the root's own
  transcript line, and the file is re-read at write time, so an assistant or
  tool line appended by the persistence outbox in the meantime survives. A
  whole-transcript rewrite from a snapshot taken outside the host lock would
  delete it (ADR 0060).
- A branch keeps growing after its archive: later prompts append to it and an
  error-ended turn never reaches `agent_end`. So every operation that discards
  the live branch first writes it back over the revision it belongs to (D307):
  `session.activateRevision` re-archives the live branch of the family from
  the durable transcript before the switch, `session.truncateFrom` archives the
  discarded tail on regenerate/retry (refreshing the stamped variant, or
  minting an inactive one), and `session.saveActiveRevision` refreshes an
  already-archived index instead of skipping it. The refresh is one more line
  in the append-only file (last record for `(rootUserId, revisionIndex)` wins)
  plus a `message_count` update. The variant named by the live root's
  `activeRevision` stamp is the one refreshed; a stamped variant with no index
  row yet (its turn failed before archive) is stored as its own new variant,
  never over a previous one.


### 4.10 artifacts — files a session produced

Backs the Artifacts surface (benchmark §3.7). v1 planned to derive this from
`audit_log`, but audit payloads never recorded file paths; an explicit
projection is precise, indexed, and survives audit pruning.

```sql
CREATE TABLE artifacts (
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  path       TEXT NOT NULL,               -- absolute, workspace-resolved
  op         TEXT NOT NULL,               -- write | edit | delete
  turn_id    TEXT,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (session_id, path)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
CREATE INDEX idx_artifacts_time ON artifacts(updated_at DESC);
```

Upserted by host-core in the same transaction as the `tool_execute` audit row
whenever Write/Edit (or a plugin tool declaring file effects) succeeds —
repeat edits update `op`/`updated_at`, keeping one row per file per session.
Writes into the session scratch directory (D114) are excluded: artifacts list
workspace deliverables only.

### 4.11 scheduled_tasks + task_runs — automations

Moves scheduled tasks out of Electron's `scheduled-tasks.json` (D002 fix) and
adds the run-history the Automations page needs (定时任务 / 运行记录 tabs).

```sql
CREATE TABLE scheduled_tasks (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title       TEXT NOT NULL,
  prompt      TEXT NOT NULL,
  cadence     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'manual',  -- manual | hourly | daily | weekly
  enabled     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  project_id  INTEGER REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  config_json TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',      -- mode, cron expr, model override, notify policy
  last_run_at INTEGER,
  created_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE task_runs (
  id         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id    TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES scheduled_tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  session_id TEXT REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE SET NULL, -- the run's transcript
  status     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'running',  -- running | completed | aborted | error
  error_code TEXT,
  started_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  ended_at   INTEGER
);
CREATE INDEX idx_task_runs ON task_runs(task_id, started_at DESC);
```

A run that spawns a session gets its transcript for free via `session_id`.
Finer schedules (cron) land in `config_json` without a migration.

Scheduled task `config_json.mode` is a durable operating-mode value. There is
intentionally no physical `scheduled_tasks.mode` column. The v7→v8
and v9/v10→v11 migration paths map legacy `chat` values to `plan`; new scheduled
tasks default to `agent`, and create/update/import normalize the same values.
The top-level wire `ScheduledTask.mode` is only a normalized projection of this
JSON value.
A scheduled or unattended run whose mode is a contract mode (Plan or Goal) is
explicitly rejected before provider work, `.pi/<kind>/*.md` creation, approval,
or queue insertion with `PLAN_REQUIRES_INTERACTIVE_SESSION` — one shared code
for both kinds. It cannot display an approval card or auto-approve a proposal in
the background. The user must explicitly switch the task/session to Agent before
an unattended run can execute.

### 4.12 secrets_meta

Registry of which secrets exist (blob files are sha256-named and otherwise
unenumerable). `owner_kind/owner_id` generalizes v1's provider-only column for
future plugin/MCP secrets.

```sql
CREATE TABLE secrets_meta (
  secret_ref TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  owner_kind TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'provider',
  owner_id   TEXT,
  kind       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'api_key',
  backend    TEXT NOT NULL,                -- file_fallback (safe_storage reserved)
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

Secret *values* never enter the DB (D028/D031). The shipped backend is the
host-core file store: AES-256-GCM ciphertexts under `secrets/`, keyed by a
machine key that host-core generates once and keeps beside them as
`secrets/.machine-key` (owner-only file mode). host-core records
`file_fallback` for every write; the `safe_storage` value is reserved for an
OS keychain backend that neither host-core nor Electron main implements today,
so a same-user process that can read the data directory can also decrypt the
secrets.

### 4.13 audit_log

Append-only; now indexed and prunable. Integer autoincrement PK replaces v1's
random uuids (cheaper inserts, natural order).

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  ts           INTEGER NOT NULL,
  kind         TEXT NOT NULL,              -- tool_execute | tool_denied | …
  session_id   TEXT,
  payload_json TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'
);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_ts ON audit_log(ts);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_session ON audit_log(session_id, ts)
  WHERE session_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### 4.14 notifications — durable local inbox (D117)

One row records one terminal agent-turn outcome that was not already visible in
the focused current chat. It stores structured source data only; renderer and
Electron derive localized title/body strings at the presentation boundary.

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  kind          TEXT NOT NULL
                  CHECK (kind IN ('task.completed', 'task.failed')),
  session_id    TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  session_title TEXT NOT NULL,              -- snapshot at terminal transition
  turn_id       TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,       -- exactly one inbox row per turn
  error_code    TEXT,                       -- populated for task.failed when known
  created_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  read_at       INTEGER
);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_created
  ON notifications(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_unread
  ON notifications(created_at DESC) WHERE read_at IS NULL;
```

- `session.endTurn` always updates the turn and, when `createNotification` is
  true, inserts `task.completed` for `completed` or `task.failed` for `error`
  in the **same transaction**. Electron passes false only when the main window
  is visible/focused and that exact session is the current chat. `aborted`
  never inserts a row.
- Repeating a terminal update cannot duplicate a notification because
  `turn_id` is unique. The RPC result includes the record only when this call
  inserted it; otherwise the `notification` field is omitted.
- `session_title` is the stable session-name snapshot at notification creation,
  not a localized notification title/body. An empty title remains valid and
  receives a localized “Untitled task” fallback only at presentation time.
- No title/body prose is stored. Permission requests, scheduled reminders,
  plugin notices, and aborted turns are not notification sources.
- After an insert, the same transaction prunes all but the newest 200 rows by
  `(created_at DESC, id DESC)`. This is a global cap; session deletion also
  cascades its rows.
- Mark-read updates are idempotent (`read_at` changes only from null), mark all
  read is one indexed update, and clear deletes notification rows only. None of
  these operations changes sessions, turns, or transcripts.

### Dropped from v1

| v1 table | v2 home |
|---|---|
| `meta` | `PRAGMA user_version` |
| `settings` | `kv(ns='app')` |
| `workspace` (singleton) | `projects` + `kv(app, currentProjectId)` |
| `plugins` (dead code) | `plugins/registry.json` stays authoritative (spec 07-11); plugin *settings* → `kv(ns='plugin:<id>')` |
| `provider_models` (dead code) | `models` |

## 5. Write paths (consistency)

Persistence points follow [10-session-state-machine](10-session-state-machine.md) §4;
streaming deltas never touch storage. Message writes are two steps in a fixed
order — **transcript file first, index transaction second** (§2.1): the file
is the source of truth, the index is derived and self-healing.

| event | file step | index/DB transaction |
|---|---|---|
| prompt accepted | append user message line | `last_seq` alloc (RETURNING) + index row + touch `sessions.updated_at`; then insert `turns(running)` |
| assistant/tool message end | append message line; remove the in-flight checkpoint when its id matches | index row + touch session |
| streaming reply checkpoint (`session.saveInflightMessage`, D299) | atomically replace `<id>.inflight.json`; no-op for an empty message or an id already indexed | — |
| context checkpoint (`session.appendCompaction`) | append typed checkpoint line after its referenced message boundary | — (checkpoint is not searchable transcript content) |
| tool succeeded (Write/Edit) | — | upsert `artifacts` + `audit_log` row, same tx as result persistence |
| turn terminal via `session.endTurn` | `completed`/`error`: remove the in-flight checkpoint only when its id is already indexed; otherwise leave it for the outbox or boot (D327). `recoverInflight`: append the leftover as `complete` when the turn is `completed`, otherwise as `aborted`, when its final row never landed | update `turns`; for completed/error insert one notification and prune to 200 in the same tx; aborted inserts none; a promoted checkpoint gets an index row under the turn |
| plan/goal submission | host writes the exact Markdown bytes to a new unique `<workspaceRoot>/.pi/<kind>/*.md` file | insert one `plan_approvals(pending)` row with the kind, structured title/question, artifact path/hash/size, and expiry before emitting the approval request |
| plan/goal approval | verify the immutable artifact path/hash/size | atomically resolve `plan_approvals`, update `sessions.mode` and explicit `permission_mode`, and set `execution_state = 'queued'`; reject/expiry stay in the contract mode |
| transcript truncate / retry / edit (`session.truncateFrom`) | host-owned suffix cut: abort leftover running turn, archive discarded regenerate tail, atomic prefix rewrite (temp + rename); preserve only a checkpoint whose boundary remains | single tx via `replace_messages`: delete index rows, bulk reinsert carrying each surviving message's owning `turn_id`, reset `last_seq`; drop inflight checkpoint |
| message delete / unanswered smart Stop (`session.replaceMessages`) | atomic transcript rewrite (temp + rename); preserve only a checkpoint whose boundary remains | single tx: delete index rows, bulk reinsert carrying each surviving message's owning `turn_id`, reset `last_seq`; smart Stop keeps its structured composer snapshot only in renderer memory |

| session fork (`session.fork`) | write a new transcript with remapped message/tool-call ids; copy/remap the checkpoint only when its boundary is included | single tx: clone session configuration, insert child index rows, set `last_seq`; remove child file on failure |
| regenerate branch save | append revision line (with `revisionIndex`: a refresh line for that existing variant) | index row with `message_count` (+ `is_active` flip); a refresh only updates `message_count` |
| turn-completion branch archive (`session.saveActiveRevision`) | append revision line (a refresh line when the active variant is already archived), then rewrite only the root user's transcript line for the pager stamp | index row with `message_count` (+ `is_active` flip); index rows for other messages untouched |
| revision switch | append a refresh line for the live branch's own variant, read the target branch, atomic transcript rewrite keeping checkpoints whose anchors survive | flip `is_active`, rebuild index rows carrying each surviving message's owning `turn_id`, reset `last_seq` |
| import | write transcript file | one tx per session: session row + index rows; on failure the file is removed |
| session delete | remove both session files after row delete | `DELETE FROM sessions` (cascades); Electron main drops that session's outbox entries (D318) |
| project delete (`projects.remove`) | remove each owned session's files after its row delete | one tx per session (`DELETE FROM sessions`, cascades) plus the project row and its `projectMemory` kv entry; the project folder on disk is never touched |
| orphaned session restore (boot / `session.appendMessage`, D318) | leave the live JSONL in place | reinsert the missing `sessions` row and rebuild index rows from the file; if the file is also gone, append inserts a stub row under the existing id so the outbox can drain |

Rules: user message durable (fsync'd file line) before the turn starts;
assistant/tool lines durable at their end events; the streaming assistant
reply is additionally checkpointed at most every 1.5 s (D299), and the
finished `message_end` snapshot is checkpointed before the outbox append
(D327), so a quit or crash mid-turn loses at most the last checkpoint
interval of the in-flight reply plus any tool rows still running. The boot
sweep promotes a leftover checkpoint whose final row never landed: as
`complete` when the turn already completed, otherwise as `aborted` under an
`aborted` turn. `completed`/`error` endTurn does not delete an unindexed
checkpoint. A user Stop does not touch the checkpoint, because the runtime's
own aborted final row is still on its way and removes it on arrival.
Electron handshake awaits the outbox drain before a cold `session.get`.
Renderer-side Stop never rewrites a transcript that has a
started reply (spec 01 §5.3); its only rewrite is the undo of an unanswered
prompt, computed from the full durable transcript merged with the live rows.
A checkpoint is installed into the live runtime only after its append succeeds;
therefore a failed/crashed checkpoint write leaves the previous full context or
previous checkpoint authoritative rather than creating a memory-only state.
A crash between file append and index commit leaves the message readable
(transcript loads from the file) with only its search row missing until the
next rewrite; transcript reads dedupe repeated ids keep-last.

The renderer never needs the whole JSONL file to open a session. Its
`session.get` request may specify a zero-based exclusive `messageBefore`, a
positive `messageLimit`, and a positive `contentLimit`. Host-core returns only
that message window and applies the content cap only to the derived `UiMessage`
projection. The full transcript remains lossless on disk and the sidecar's
uncapped `session.get` path is unchanged for model context, edits, revisions,
and other host-owned mutations. The renderer opens with the newest window and
requests older windows on demand; the response's `messageStart` and
`hasMoreBefore` fields are the only pagination state it needs.

A bounded window is served through a per-session **transcript layout**: the byte
offset of every message and compaction line, plus the file length those offsets
were recorded against. Serving a window then seeks to its first selected line
instead of parsing the history in front of it, so the cost of opening a session
is proportional to the window rather than to the conversation. Consequences:

- The layout is derived data, cached in memory and rebuilt by scanning the file.
  `file_len` is its validity token: the transcript is append-only between atomic
  rewrites, so a longer file is scanned from the previous end and a shorter or
  replaced file is rescanned in full. Every rewrite and delete path also drops
  the cached entry, because a rewrite can land on an identical length.
- A torn trailing line (crash mid-append) is excluded from both the offsets and
  `file_len`, so a later refresh picks it up once the writer completes it.
- Line classification reads the `type` discriminator with a single depth-aware
  scan, never by parsing the line into a value. Only a **top-level** `type` key
  decides the kind: tool results and checkpoint details are open-ended JSON and
  may nest an object whose own `type` names a line kind. `type` is written
  **first** on every new line so the scan usually stops at the first key, and
  lines written before that ordering carry it after their payload and are read
  by the same scan.
- Window offsets are **physical message-line positions**, the same space the
  layout counts in. They are never clamped against the session index counter
  (`last_seq`), which is a deduplicated logical count: a file line whose index
  commit never landed leaves the counter permanently behind the file, and
  clamping to it cut the newest messages out of the tail.
- The compaction chain is always returned whole with any window, because the
  newest checkpoint drives model context regardless of which messages are
  visible.

A regenerate or edit-resend names its cut by **message identity**, not by a
count. The renderer holds a bounded, deduplicated, display-filtered view, so an
index into it is not a transcript position; the host resolves the named message
against its own transcript and rejects a boundary it cannot find rather than
truncating at a guessed position.

## 6. Performance notes

- Single writer + WAL: readers never block; no lock contention by design.
- All timestamps INTEGER Unix ms — smaller rows, integer compares, index-friendly.
- Hot queries and their indexes:
  - renderer transcript open → one sequential streaming read of the JSONL file
    for the requested window; only the bounded page and capped display values
    cross the host/Electron/renderer boundary
  - full transcript consumers → one sequential read of
    `sessions/<id>.jsonl` (no DB), retained for sidecar context and mutations
  - session list → `idx_sessions_updated`
  - group-by-project → `idx_sessions_project`
  - badges/cost rollup → `idx_turns_session` (latest turn per session)
  - global token history → `idx_turns_ended_at` (completed turns by end time)
  - artifacts by session → PK; global recent artifacts → `idx_artifacts_time`
  - run history → `idx_task_runs`
  - audit forensics/pruning → `idx_audit_session` / `idx_audit_ts`
  - notification inbox → `idx_notifications_created`; unread filter/count →
    `idx_notifications_unread`
- O(1) `seq` allocation; no `MAX()+1` scans anywhere.
- `prepare_cached` on all statements; batch inserts inside one tx (import,
  replace).
- JSON columns are read blind on hot paths (shipped to the renderer as-is);
  anything filtered or summed is a promoted column by rule.

## 7. Versioning, v7 reset, and v8-to-v15 migration

- `PRAGMA user_version` stays the schema authority; future structural changes
  add ordered Rust migration fns again, each in one transaction, with a
  `pi.sqlite.v<n>.bak` copy before destructive steps.
- **v7 is a breaking reset (D119), not a migration.** Opening a database with
  `user_version` 1–6 WAL-checkpoints it, renames it to `pi.sqlite.v6.bak`
  (removing stale `-wal`/`-shm` siblings), and bootstraps a fresh v7 file.
  Sessions, providers, and settings from the old file are not carried over;
  the archive remains for manual recovery. All pre-v7 migration code
  (v1 `settings.sqlite` import, v2→v6 chain) is deleted.
- Fresh installs run the full v15 DDL directly.
- **Schema v7 first reaches v8, then uses the guarded path.** The v7→v8
  migration is followed by the same guarded v8→v15 migration; schema-v9 and
  schema-v10 databases take the same guarded path and receive an exact readable
  `pi.sqlite.v9.bak` / `pi.sqlite.v10.bak` before destructive work.
- **The historical v8-to-v11 core migration is in-place and transactional.** Before migration,
  host-core checkpoints the WAL, then creates the exact readable
  `pi.sqlite.v8.bak`; both happen before destructive work. Within one atomic
  transaction it:
  1. validates every `sessions.mode` value and maps `chat` to `plan`;
  2. parses the structured app settings value and maps its top-level
     `defaultMode: "chat"` to `"plan"`;
  3. parses each scheduled task's `config_json` and maps its top-level stored
     `mode: "chat"` to `"plan"`, leaving nested extension modes untouched;
  4. preserves/migrates the existing `plan_approvals` table and adds its
     artifact and execution fields/indexes;
  5. preserves transcripts, turns, revisions, projects, permissions, grants,
     providers, and scheduled task history;
  6. validates all new mode values as `plan | goal | agent`; and
  7. validates `defaultCommandShell` as a known current-platform catalog ID,
     retaining a valid ID that is temporarily unavailable so normal runtime
     fallback can select the first available shell; and
  8. adds `plan_approvals.kind` (`NOT NULL DEFAULT 'plan'`, checked against
     `plan | goal`) when the column is absent, probing `pragma_table_info`
     first so a v8 database that already created the table from the current DDL
     is not altered twice; existing rows are Plan contracts by definition, which
     is exactly the column default; and
  9. sets `PRAGMA user_version = 11` only after every change succeeds; the
     subsequent v14 migration adds the plugin-session ownership sidecar.
  A malformed app-settings value, malformed scheduled-task `config_json`,
  invalid session or top-level scheduled mode, unknown or wrong-platform
  `defaultCommandShell`, parse, constraint, or write failure fails closed,
  rolls back the transaction, and leaves the pre-migration schema
  authoritative; the backup
  remains available for recovery.
  Legacy `planApprovalPermissionMode` is removed from the app settings JSON
  during migration; all unrelated settings remain intact.

- **Schema v15 is additive.** It adds the `turn_queue` table and its two
  indexes (D386 / ADR 0213) so the Host-owned turn queue survives a restart;
  no existing row changes, and a `pi.sqlite.v14.bak` copy precedes the step.
- **Schema v16 is additive.** It adds the session collaboration link and
  delivery tables, their lifecycle indexes, and the nullable
  `turn_queue.session_message_id` binding (D409 / ADR 0239). Existing
  conversations, turns, queue entries, and plugin data remain valid. A
  `pi.sqlite.v15.bak` copy precedes the migration; boot recovery retains
  durable queued deliveries but never replays interrupted work automatically.
- **Schema v14 is additive.** It adds nullable `sessions.deleted_at`, the
  partial deletion index, and `session_import_origins`. Existing sessions stay
  active and have no origin rows. The migration runs in the same guarded
  transaction and leaves the pre-v14 backup until the new schema passes its
  integrity checks.

The `largePasteThreshold` app setting is additive JSON rather than a database
schema field. Host settings reads normalize a missing, malformed, or
out-of-range value to 600, and settings writes validate the integer range of
1–1,000,000. Existing databases therefore gain the default lazily without a
destructive migration or a second settings store.
- Plan and Goal artifacts are never reconstructed from transcript content. On
  startup,
  one transaction marks every `pending` approval and every `queued` or
  `running` execution state in `plan_approvals` as `interrupted`; associated
  running turns are marked `aborted` before RPC service begins. Pending
  sessions remain in their contract mode and already-approved queued/running
  sessions remain Agent. No approval response or execution from before the
  restart is accepted.
- The transcript file format carries its own `schema` field in the session
  header line; unknown line types are skipped, so additive file-format growth
  needs no reset.

## 8. Retention & maintenance

- audit_log: prune rows older than 90 days (configurable) at boot;
  `incremental_vacuum` afterwards.
- task_runs: keep last 100 per task (prune with the same boot pass).
- notifications: enforce the newest-200 global cap after every insert and at
  boot as a defensive repair; rows otherwise survive restart until cleared,
  pruned, or cascade-deleted with their session.
- transcript files: user data, never pruned or swept — removed only with
  their session (delete or scheduled-run cleanup). Orphan files (session row
  gone, file present) are preserved, not garbage-collected: the file is the
  source of truth and a future re-index can recover it.
- logs rotate at the file layer (D082); sessions are never auto-deleted.
- Attachment GC (later): sweep `attachments/` for hashes unreferenced by any
  transcript file.

## 9. Extensibility playbook

| need | mechanism | migration? |
|---|---|---|
| new message content kind (citations, diffs, voice) | new block `type` in the transcript file | no |
| new per-response metadata | `meta` key in the message line | no |
| new transcript line kind | new JSONL `type` (readers skip unknown) | no |
| new config domain (MCP servers, memories) | `kv` namespace | no |
| new provider/task knob | `config_json` key | no |
| new model capability | value in `capabilities_json` | no |
| new queryable/filterable field | promoted column | yes (additive) |
| new entity with relations (knowledge base, connectors) | new table | yes |

Rule of thumb: files/JSON for payloads the host merely stores and ships;
columns for anything the host filters, joins, sums, or indexes.

## 10. Secrets rules (unchanged)

1. The renderer never persists secrets
2. OS safeStorage remains the target primary backend; the shipped store is the
   encrypted-file backend (`file_fallback`) with its machine key beside the
   ciphertexts, and Settings must state that risk
3. Secret values never in SQLite; only `secrets_meta` bookkeeping
4. Exported sessions exclude secrets by default

## 11. Acceptance

1. Sessions and transcripts survive restart byte-identically (blocks, usage,
   tool results) — content reloads from `sessions/<id>.jsonl` with no
   UI-projection loss
2. Transcript load for a 5k-message session is one sequential file read; no
   message-content SQL on the hot path
3. Kill -9 during a running turn: boot marks the turn `aborted`, transcript
   intact up to the last fsync'd message line; a torn trailing line is
   skipped on read
4. Kill -9 between file append and index commit: the message still renders
   after restart; search misses it only until the next transcript rewrite
5. Opening a pre-v7 database archives it as `pi.sqlite.v6.bak` and starts a
   fresh v7 file; reopening the fresh file is a plain open
6. Scheduled tasks CRUD + run history round-trip through host RPC only
7. FTS finds CJK and ASCII substrings across sessions; deleting a session
   removes its index entries and both session files
8. Plugin uninstall clears `kv(plugin:<id>)` in one statement
9. Resetting sidebar preferences changes no `projects`, `sessions`, or
   transcript data; retained paths and organization choices survive a normal
   renderer restart when preferences are available
10. A tool call for session A resolves A's persisted project root even after
    the visible workspace switches to project B
11. A session's thinking level survives restart
12. Assistant thinking blocks round-trip independently from final answer text;
    the derived search text excludes thinking content
13. Regenerated assistant variants survive restart in
    `sessions/<id>.revisions.jsonl`; the live root user turn reloads with
    `revisionCount` / `activeRevision`, the pager can restore any archived
    branch, and switching branches never rewrites the revisions file
14. Completed and failed turns atomically create one durable notification;
    repeated terminal updates do not duplicate it, aborted turns create none,
    and the newest-200 cap survives restart
15. Notification list/unread, mark-read, mark-all-read, clear, and session
    cascade deletion use the documented indexes/transactions without changing
    turn or transcript data
16. Schema v7 first reaches v8 and then uses the guarded v8→v11 path. The
    v8→v11 migration is one atomic transaction with a WAL checkpoint and exact
    readable `pi.sqlite.v8.bak` before destructive work; schema v9 and v10
    receive `pi.sqlite.v9.bak` / `pi.sqlite.v10.bak`. Persisted session,
    app-default, and scheduled `chat`
    values map to `plan`, sessions/transcripts and `plan_approvals` artifact/
    execution fields survive, `plan_approvals.kind` is added with existing rows
    defaulting to `plan`, and malformed app settings/scheduled config,
    invalid modes, or invalid default shells fail closed with the pre-migration
    schema intact
17. SubmitPlan and SubmitGoal write exact Markdown bytes to a unique
    `.pi/plan/*.md` or `.pi/goal/*.md` file
    with SHA-256 and size; title/question stay structured and renderer reload
    retains only the pending row and original absolute deadline
18. Full process restart marks pending/queued/running approval rows interrupted,
    aborts associated turns, performs no replay, keeps pending sessions in their
    contract mode,
    keeps already-approved interrupted sessions Agent, and rejects stale responses
19. A scheduled or unattended Plan **or Goal** run fails before provider/artifact/
    queue work with `PLAN_REQUIRES_INTERACTIVE_SESSION`; no background path
    auto-approves either kind
20. Schema v14 plugin imports have host-generated session ids, one origin row per
    session, `(pluginId, source, externalId)` idempotency, no project or model
    binding unless an explicit host-created `projectId` is supplied,
    ownership-scoped reads/mutations, and recoverable trash before purge.
21. Schema v16 collaboration rows preserve source/target Session IDs and
    idempotency across retries, bind deliveries to their actual target turns,
    persist transcript provenance, create no duplicate completion callback,
    enforce permission ceilings and hop limits, retain queued work across a
    restart without replay, and cancel without deleting the target session.



## Active-turn steering transcript reservations

An accepted steering input is journaled through Electron's existing message
outbox with `meta.steering: true`, round-tripped as `UiMessage.steering`. Smart
Stop preserves that input even after renderer reload loses submission state.
If an assistant is still streaming, its provisional snapshot is queued
first to reserve its transcript position before the new user row. The host
stores the provisional row and an in-flight checkpoint, including an empty
reservation so crash recovery can settle it. Further stream checkpoints remain
valid while the indexed assistant has `status: streaming`.

`session.appendMessage` retains idempotent replay for completed messages. Its
narrow exception lets a terminal assistant replace an indexed streaming
assistant with the same session/message id. It updates exactly that transcript
line and search text, retaining sequence, owning turn and every other row.
Late partial snapshots and duplicate terminal snapshots cannot overwrite the
settled result. Recovery promotes the latest checkpoint in that same position.
The outbox likewise keeps a newer snapshot that replaces an append while its
host call is still pending. No schema migration is required.
