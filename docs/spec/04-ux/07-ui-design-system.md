# 07. UI Design System

## 1. Goals

1. Provide a **single source of truth** for visual tokens, component foundations, and layout metrics across PI-Desktop
2. Ensure **high readability and contrast** in both light and dark themes — this is a developer workstation, not a marketing surface
3. Map all design decisions to **Tailwind CSS tokens** so that spec → implementation is unambiguous
4. Enable **future shadcn-like primitive extraction** without re-specifying foundations

## Visual baseline (Codex-aligned)

The desktop shell targets a 1:1 visual match with the local Codex desktop client (ChatGPT.app electron-dark): charcoal surfaces (`#181818`), neutral gray scale (not blue-slate), ~275px sidebar, 46px toolbar rhythm, and a floating pill composer. Semantic token names remain stable; values follow the Codex gray system with a **neutral gray accent** (no blue brand accent).

## 2. Non-goals

1. A consumer-brand identity system with vibrant gradients or playful illustrations
2. A full component library spec (that is [08-component-spec.md](08-component-spec.md))
3. Custom font services or CDN font hosting — use local bundling
4. Complex theme marketplace or user-customizable color palettes (MVP: system/light/dark only)
5. Pixel-perfect Figma handoff artifacts

## 3. Visual principles

| Principle | Application |
|---|---|
| **Clarity over decoration** | No ornamental borders, gradients, or hero images. Every visual element carries information. |
| **Developer density** | Compact spacing, small-but-readable type, minimal marketing whitespace. Information-rich, not sparse. |
| **Dark-base defaults** | Dark theme is the primary theme for a coding agent. Light must be fully supported but is secondary. |
| **Restraint** | One accent color family. No rainbow status colors — use semantic token names (success, warning, error). |
| **Motion as feedback** | Animations convey state change (streaming, loading, expand/collapse). Never decorative. |
| **Keyboard-first** | Focus rings, tab order, and shortcut labels are primary UX, not afterthoughts. |
| **Continuous shell chrome** | Titlebars stay borderless and continuous with their surfaces; reserve faint separators for boundaries that clarify ownership, such as the window-control side seam. |

### 3.1 AI-generated page copy

AI-generated page surfaces use concise, task-oriented copy:

- Keep visible text to labels, headings, actions, statuses, and helper text that changes a user decision or clarifies non-obvious behavior.
- Do not add filler introductions, repeated summaries, implementation notes, or prose that merely explains an obvious control or layout.
- Empty states default to a title and the next useful action. Keep body text only for required context, risk, error cause, or a non-obvious next step.
- Preserve permission, security, validation, destructive-action, keyboard, path/scope, and error details even when they are longer.
- Put rationale, usage guidance, and implementation detail in documentation or code comments rather than page UI unless the user requests it.

### 3.2 Text selection

PI-Desktop behaves like a desktop application shell, so accidental drag
selection is suppressed for chrome by default. The selection contract is:

- Navigation, titlebar chrome, buttons, labels, badges, menus, and other
  controls are not text-selectable.
- `input`, `textarea`, `select`, and editable content remain selectable so
  users can edit drafts, search, and use native `Cmd/Ctrl+A/C/V` behavior.
- Transcript message bodies, rendered Markdown, code blocks, and tool
  input/output remain selectable for copy and inspection.
- New document-like surfaces must opt into the shared `.selectable` class (or
  an equivalent explicit `user-select: text` rule).
- The Electron renderer sets both `user-select` and `-webkit-user-select`;
  selection rules must not remove focus-visible rings or window drag regions.
- Copyable selection paint uses the monochrome accent contract via
  `::selection` (`color-mix` of `--ds-text-primary` at ~18% over the surface,
  text remains `--ds-text-primary`). Browser-default blue highlights are not
  allowed on shell surfaces.
- `caret-color` and `accent-color` resolve to `--ds-text-primary` /
  `--ds-accent` so native carets and form accents stay on-theme.
- Focus-visible rings use `color-mix(in oklab, var(--ds-accent) 80%, transparent)`
  (no white wash that drifts off the neutral ramp).

### 3.3 Locale-aware chrome labels

Section labels that use Latin micro-style (`text-transform: uppercase` +
`letter-spacing: wide`) must relax under `:lang(zh-CN)`:

- `letter-spacing` returns to `--tracking-normal`
- `text-transform` is `none` (CJK has no case and wide tracking splits glyphs)

Applies to sidebar section labels, settings rail group labels, destination
section labels, and keyboard-shortcut group labels.

Plugin panel chrome follows the same shell context: the host reserves exactly
a transparent 46px drag band and renders only a minimal page-adaptive capsule
with three window controls at the fixed top-right corner. The capsule stays
inside that band, uses the panel page's computed surface/text colors with the
active theme as a transparent-page fallback, and must not force a black surface
on a light plugin page. The band is not clickable outside the capsule;
development panels expose a localized reminder. The plugin owns its title,
toolbar, and every other visible panel surface.

Plugin pages that use the current chrome contract declare
`<meta name="pi-plugin-chrome" content="v2">` and lay out normal-flow content
with `--pi-plugin-titlebar-height`. Detached panels publish `46px`; docked
views publish `0px`. The host does not add a second top padding to v2 pages,
which keeps the capsule's safe band from becoming an empty spacer. Pages without
the marker retain the additive legacy offset so older installed plugins remain
usable while they migrate.

When a plugin page uses a stable scrollbar gutter, it belongs on that page's
content scroller only. The root `html`/`body` viewport must not reserve another
gutter, because Windows' classic scrollbars make the duplicate visible as an
empty rail outside the panel surface.

### 3.4 Product identity and marks

The visible product identity is **PI-Desktop**, even where the shell borrows
Codex as a visual reference. The identity contract is deliberately small:

- The sidebar shell name, settings copy, and composer placeholder use
  `PI-Desktop`; `Codex` is reserved for the external session-import source or
  historical design-reference text.
- `build/icon_1024.png` is the canonical shell logo master; the renderer
  imports the 192x192 marks derived from it under `src/assets/brand/`
  (ADR 0125). `BrandLogo` imports those
  through Vite so the renderer bundle, development Dock, and packaged
  application all use the same visual asset.
- On macOS, both development and packaged launches expose `PI-Desktop` as the
  native application-menu name. The native About panel uses the PI-Desktop
  name, version, and canonical icon; no stock Electron name or icon is visible.
  Development launches use a generated branded host bundle because AppKit
  reads this identity from the host bundle rather than Electron runtime APIs.
- On Windows, Electron Main registers the canonical `com.pi-desktop.app`
  AppUserModelID before readiness. The runtime ID, packaged executable name,
  and NSIS shortcut identity stay aligned so native notifications,
  notification settings, and taskbar groups identify the app as `PI-Desktop`
  rather than Electron.
- The empty-home hero uses a 100px `HomeMascotLogo` GIF: an eight-frame waving
  mascot compiled from the supplied light and dark action sets, with a short
  idle hold on the first frame. CSS selects the pair from
  `document.documentElement[data-theme]`; anything other than `light` uses the
  dark artwork. Playback is native to the GIF. There is no random pose
  selection, JavaScript timer, or hover-driven speed change. Reduced motion
  swaps the GIF for the matching first-frame PNG without changing the 100px
  slot.
  `BrandLogo` remains 20px/18px in the expanded/collapsed sidebar and 64px in
  the startup splash. Composer prompt rows do not render a leading brand icon
  in either home or thread-docked mode.
- The empty-home hero keeps three session identities: project sessions retain
  the underlined project action, temporary sessions use dedicated temporary
  chat copy without a project or folder action, and no active session uses the
  generic welcome copy. The state is derived from the selected session, not
  merely from the visible workspace.
- New-session controls use the dedicated message-plus icon at 15–16px. The
  generic plus icon remains reserved for non-session additions such as adding
  a project.
- Marks are decorative (`aria-hidden`); the surrounding controls provide the
  localized accessible names and keyboard behavior.

## 4. Color tokens

### 4.1 Semantic token naming

All color references in components use **semantic token names**, never raw hex values.

```text
--color-bg-primary        → main background (chat area, panels)
--color-bg-secondary      → sidebar, cards, nested surfaces
--color-bg-tertiary       → hover states, elevated surfaces
--color-bg-inset          → code blocks, inset areas
--color-text-primary      → main body text
--color-text-secondary    → secondary/label text
--color-text-muted        → disabled, placeholder, hint
--color-border-default    → default borders
--color-border-subtle     → subtle separators (divider lines)
--color-accent            → primary accent (CTA, active states)
--color-accent-hover      → accent hover
--color-success           → success/run states
--color-warning           → warning/caution states
--color-error             → error/denied states
--color-info              → informational states
```

### 4.2 Dark theme (primary)

| Token | Hex | Tailwind mapping | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--color-bg-primary` | `#181818` | Codex `gray-900` | Main surface |
| `--color-bg-sidebar` / under | `#000000` (dark) / `#f3f3f3` (light) | Codex `surface-under` / gray-75 | Sidebar rail |
| `--ds-bg-sidebar-image` | `none` (optional `<image>`) | — | Sidebar `background-image` only (gradients / pictures). `--ds-bg-sidebar` stays a color for glass tint, borders, and `color-mix` |
| `--color-bg-secondary` | `#212121` | Codex `gray-800` | Elevated surfaces, composer |
| `--color-bg-tertiary` | `#282828` | Codex `gray-750` | Hover / opaque elevated |
| `--color-bg-inset` | `#0d0d0d` | Codex `gray-1000` | Code blocks, deepest inset |
| `--color-text-primary` | `#FFFFFF` | Codex `gray-0` | Body text |
| `--color-text-secondary` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.70)` | Codex secondary | Labels, secondary |
| `--color-text-muted` | `#5d5d5d` | Codex `gray-500` | Disabled, hints |
| `--color-border-default` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` | Codex border | Default borders |
| `--color-border-subtle` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` | Codex border subtle | Subtle separators |
| `--color-accent` | `#FFFFFF` (dark) / `#1a1c1f` (light) | inverted gray ink | Primary accent, CTA |
| `--color-accent-hover` | `#EDEDED` (dark) / `#303030` (light) | gray-100 / gray-700 | Accent hover |
| `--color-accent-soft` | `#AFAFAF` (dark) / `#5d5d5d` (light) | gray-300 / gray-500 | Soft accent, links |
| `--color-success` | `#22C55E` | `text-green-500` | Success, run complete |
| `--color-warning` | `#F59E0B` | `text-amber-500` | Warning, caution |
| `--color-error` | `#EF4444` | `text-red-500` | Error, denied |
| `--color-info` | `#6366F1` | `text-indigo-500` | Informational |

### 4.3 Light theme (Codex electron-light)

Neutral gray scale only — no blue-slate surfaces. Chrome components must consume semantic `--ds-*` tokens so light ink stays dark on `#f3f3f3` / `#ffffff`.

| Token | Hex / value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-bg-primary` | `#ffffff` | Main surface |
| `--color-bg-secondary` / sidebar | `#f3f3f3` (gray-75) | Sidebar surface |
| `--color-bg-tertiary` | `#f3f3f3` | Nested / hover base |
| `--color-bg-inset` | `#ededed` (gray-100) | Code blocks, inset |
| `--color-text-primary` | `#1a1c1f` | Body + brand |
| `--color-text-secondary` | `color-mix(#1a1c1f 70%, transparent)` | Nav items, chips, thread titles |
| `--color-text-muted` | `#5d5d5d` (gray-500) | Section labels |
| `--color-text-faint` | `#afafaf` (gray-300) | Placeholder |
| `--color-border-default` | `color-mix(#1a1c1f 8%, transparent)` | Default borders |
| `--color-border-subtle` | `color-mix(#1a1c1f 5%, transparent)` | Sidebar edge / dividers |
| `--color-accent` | `#1a1c1f` | Primary accent, CTA, footer badge (neutral ink) |
| `--color-success` / warning / error | green-500 / orange-500 / red-500 | Status |

**Invariant:** never paint chrome text with raw `gray-0` (`#fff`) under `data-theme="light"`. Use `--ds-text-primary` / `--ds-text-secondary`.

Shared buttons must use semantic theme tokens for both their surface and ink:
primary actions pair `--ds-accent` with `--ds-bg-primary`, while secondary
actions sit on the `--ds-tile` fill with primary text and no stroke (D297).
Hover states use the corresponding accent/tile-hover tokens rather than
opacity-only changes, so actions remain legible in dark and light themes.

Light-surface polish (D148):

- Docked work panel uses quiet inset paper (`#fafafa`) with a white header band and a combined create trigger in the header so the tool column stays on content without any divider (D297 removed the remaining edge rules).
- The work-panel header keeps its add-tab action in a separated rail: a tokenized 60px safe lane reserves the viewport-fixed panel toggle, with at least 24px of visual separation between the two hit targets on supported window sizes.
- Shared form fields, browser URL, settings segment tracks, and shortcut keycaps use `--ds-tile` fills with no stroke (D297); focus lifts to white with an accent-tinted ring. An Unbound shortcut uses a localized text state instead of an empty keycap and keeps its recorder and restore controls keyboard-focusable.
- Settings toggles keep a near-black on-track and force a white knob in light mode.
  Off/on track and knob colours come from the `--ds-switch-*` theme tokens; a
  per-theme `:root[data-theme="…"] .settings-toggle` background override
  out-specifies `.settings-toggle.on` and strands the on-state on the off fill.
- Switch off-state carries a dim fill plus a 1px inset ring so an empty track
  still reads as a control; the dark-theme off knob stays light (`--gray-300`)
  so the knob does not disappear into the track.
- Dialog scrim softens to ~28% ink so elevated white dialogs remain readable.

### 4.4 System theme behavior

- `system` theme follows `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Transition between themes must not flash white when switching to dark on launch
- Initial load: detect system preference before first paint (Electron preload can relay this)
- Native controls inherit the active `color-scheme`. Every native `select`
  trigger and its opened `option`/`optgroup` list also uses opaque semantic
  foreground/background colors, so Windows Chromium does not fall back to an
  unreadable system palette outside Settings either.

### 4.5 Sidebar task status semantics

Compact task rows reserve one `12px` leading status slot. State is never
communicated by color alone, and each status consumes an existing semantic
token rather than introducing a decorative palette:

| State | Semantic color | Shape / motion | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Selected | neutral accent | static outlined ring | current conversation |
| In progress | warning orange | filled dot with a restrained breathing pulse | agent is producing or executing |
| Completed | success green | check mark | latest unread task turn completed |
| Failed | error red | circled alert mark | latest unread task turn failed |

Precedence is `in progress → selected → completed/failed`. Starting another
turn clears the prior terminal outcome; abort clears the live indicator without
creating a failure. Opening a conversation acknowledges its unread terminal
outcome: the terminal mark clears immediately and the matching durable task
notification is marked read so the mark cannot return after a notification
refresh or app restart. Outcomes already marked read never produce a terminal
mark. Reduced-motion mode disables the breathing animation while retaining its
orange fill and localized accessible name.

### 4.6 Tailwind CSS variable stub

The following CSS custom properties stub is the canonical bridge between spec tokens and Tailwind classes. It is **not an app source file** — it documents the intended mapping for implementation.

```css
/* === Design System Token Bridge (spec reference, not runtime file) === */
/* Dark theme (default) */
:root[data-theme="dark"] {
  --color-bg-primary:       #181818;
  --color-bg-secondary:     #212121;
  --color-bg-tertiary:      #282828;
  --color-bg-inset:         #0d0d0d;
  --color-text-primary:     #FFFFFF;
  --color-text-secondary:   rgba(255,255,255,0.70);
  --color-text-muted:       #5d5d5d;
  --color-border-default:   #282828;
  --color-border-subtle:    #212121;
  --color-accent:           #FFFFFF;
  --color-accent-hover:     #EDEDED;
  --color-success:          #22C55E;
  --color-warning:          #F59E0B;
  --color-error:            #EF4444;
  --color-info:             #6366F1;
}

/* Light theme */
:root[data-theme="light"] {
  --color-bg-primary:       #FFFFFF;
  --color-bg-secondary:     #FFFFFF;
  --color-bg-tertiary:      #F1F5F9;
  --color-bg-inset:         #F1F5F9;
  --color-text-primary:     #181818;
  --color-text-secondary:   #475569;
  --color-text-muted:       #94A3B8;
  --color-border-default:   #E2E8F0;
  --color-border-subtle:    #F1F5F9;
  --color-accent:           #1a1c1f;
  --color-accent-hover:     #303030;
  --color-success:          #16A34A;
  --color-warning:          #D97706;
  --color-error:            #DC2626;
  --color-info:             #4F46E5;
}

/* Tailwind v4 theme extension (in tailwind config) */
/* Maps semantic tokens to utility classes */
/*
@theme {
  --color-bg-primary:    var(--color-bg-primary);
  --color-bg-secondary:  var(--color-bg-secondary);
  --color-bg-tertiary:   var(--color-bg-tertiary);
  --color-bg-inset:      var(--color-bg-inset);
  --color-text-primary:  var(--color-text-primary);
  --color-text-secondary: var(--color-text-secondary);
  --color-text-muted:    var(--color-text-muted);
  --color-border-default: var(--color-border-default);
  --color-border-subtle:  var(--color-border-subtle);
  --color-accent:        var(--color-accent);
  --color-accent-hover:  var(--color-accent-hover);
  --color-success:       var(--color-success);
  --color-warning:       var(--color-warning);
  --color-error:         var(--color-error);
  --color-info:          var(--color-info);
}
*/
```

Implementation note: Tailwind v4 supports CSS-first configuration. The `@theme` directive maps custom properties to utility classes (`bg-bg-primary`, `text-text-primary`, etc.). Implementation should validate naming to avoid double-prefix collision (e.g., `bg-bg` is awkward — consider aliasing to `bg-primary`, `text-primary` etc. at the Tailwind level).

## 5. Typography

### 5.1 Font stacks

| Role | Primary | Fallback stack | Tailwind |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UI (sans)** | Inter | `system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif` | `font-sans` |
| **Code (mono)** | JetBrains Mono | `"Fira Code", ui-monospace, "Cascadia Code", "SF Mono", Menlo, Consolas, "DejaVu Sans Mono", monospace` | `font-mono` |

The UI stack is user-overridable from Settings → Basics → Appearance
(ADR 0083). The Font row persists a CSS stack in `AppSettings.fontFamily`;
an absent or empty value keeps the token stack above. Bundled open-licensed
families (Geist, Inter, Noto Sans SC, LXGW WenKai — SIL OFL 1.1) ship locally
under `apps/desktop/src/assets/fonts/` with license texts, and installed
system families are enumerated by Electron main. Every custom stack appends a
CJK fallback tier so Chinese text stays readable. The mono stack
(`--font-mono`) is not user-configurable.

The Font size row (D343 / ADR 0180) persists an optional multiplier in
`AppSettings.fontScale` (default 1, range 0.8–1.5). The renderer sets
`--font-scale` on the root so every `--text-*` token (and `--leading-row`)
scales in proportion. Shared Lucide icons use the same multiplier. Window
zoom remains independent. The UI never asks for a px value.

### 5.2 Type scale

All font sizes come from the `--text-*` ramp defined in the `@theme` block of `styles/tokens.css` (imported first by `styles/globals.css`, which is now only an import sequence — see D170). Raw px literals for `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, and `letter-spacing` are **forbidden** in component CSS and TSX arbitrary utilities (`text-[13px]` etc.) — enforced by `scripts/check-style-tokens.mjs` (runs in `pnpm lint`). `-plus` suffixed tokens are the Codex half-steps between named sizes.

| Token | Size | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--text-3xs` | 10.5px | Smallest chrome (kbd hints) |
| `--text-xs` (alias `--text-2xs`) | 11px | Timestamps, badges, tool status |
| `--text-xs-plus` | 11.5px | Muted metadata, menu subtitles |
| `--text-sm` | 12px | Secondary labels, tool rows, sidebar section labels |
| `--text-sm-plus` | 12.5px | Chips, working indicator, code text |
| `--text-md` | 13px | Sidebar session/project titles, empty-state copy, compact chrome |
| `--text-md-plus` | 13.5px | Composer labels, list rows |
| `--text-base` | 14px | Body text, chat messages, input, primary sidebar chrome |
| `--text-base-plus` | 15px | Brand, prominent labels |
| `--text-lg` | 16px | Section headers, card titles |
| `--text-lg-plus` | 18px | Large card titles |
| `--text-xl` | 20px | Page-level emphasis |
| `--text-2xl` | 28px | Destination page titles, home hero |

Line-height tokens: `--leading-none` 1, `--leading-heading` 1.15, `--leading-tighter` 1.2, `--leading-tight` 1.25, `--leading-compact` 1.3, `--leading-compact-plus` 1.35, `--leading-normal` 1.4, `--leading-body` 1.45 (app default), `--leading-relaxed` 1.5, `--leading-chat` 1.55, `--leading-prose` 1.6, `--leading-row` 18px (fixed-height sidebar rows).

Letter-spacing tokens: `--tracking-tighter` −0.03em, `--tracking-tight` −0.02em, `--tracking-normal` 0, `--tracking-wide` 0.02em.

> Note: 14px base is intentional for developer-density. Do not bump to 16px default.
> Users who want larger or denser type change Font size in Appearance; that
> multiplies the whole `--text-*` ramp through `--font-scale`.
>
> Sidebar primary chrome (nav items, footer identity, profile menu actions)
> uses `--text-base` so the left rail matches main body readability.
> Session titles, project/group titles, and empty-state copy use the compact
> `--text-md` tier; only section labels and secondary metadata use `--text-sm`.
> Never use the micro `--text-xs` band for primary list content.

### 5.3 Code text sizing

- Code blocks and tool output: `--text-sm`/`--text-sm-plus` with `font-mono`
- Inline code within messages: `--text-sm-plus` `font-mono`, soft text-tint background, borderless, rounded
- Chat prose (`.prose-chat`) uses `--text-base` / `--leading-prose` for body, with a heading ramp of `text-xl` → `text-lg-plus` → `text-lg` → `text-base-plus` → `text-base` so multi-block answers stay scannable without document-scale drama. Headings carry no rules/borders (hierarchy comes from size, weight, and space above); links keep a soft permanent underline that firms up on hover instead of relying on color alone; blockquotes are a quiet 2px left rail without a background fill

### 5.4 Weight rules

Weights use `--font-weight-*` tokens only (Codex uses variable-font intermediate weights):

- `--font-weight-normal` 400: default body/label text
- `--font-weight-medium` 500: emphasis, chips, row titles
- `--font-weight-medium-plus` 520: select Codex chrome labels
- `--font-weight-strong` 560: destination page titles (Codex electron metric)
- `--font-weight-semibold` 600: brand, CTA buttons
- Never use 700+

## 6. Spacing, radius, elevation, borders

### 6.1 Spacing scale

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `space-0.5` | 2px | Tight inline gaps |
| `space-1` | 4px | Icon-text gaps, badge padding |
| `space-1.5` | 6px | Compact inner padding |
| `space-2` | 8px | Standard inner padding, list gaps |
| `space-3` | 12px | Card inner padding, section gaps |
| `space-4` | 16px | Section margins, composer padding |
| `space-6` | 24px | Panel gaps, major separations |
| `space-8` | 32px | Page-level margins (rare) |

### 6.2 Radius scale

All radii come from `--radius-*` tokens (raw px forbidden, same guard as typography):

The scale follows Apple's current shape guidance while preserving the density
of a desktop coding tool:

- Fixed rounded rectangles are the default for compact and medium controls.
- Capsules are reserved for pills, segmented selections, status labels, and
  intentionally prominent actions; circles are reserved for equal-width icon
  controls, avatars, and dots.
- Nested surfaces should be concentric where their corners visually align:
  `outer radius = inner radius + the gap between their edges`.
- Radius grows with surface size and elevation. Full-width structural panels
  such as the sidebar, titlebar, and work panel remain square at the window
  edge.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--radius-3xs` | 4px | Inline code |
| `--radius-2xs` | 6px | Small inline chips |
| `--radius-xs` | 8px | Compact buttons, copy buttons |
| `--radius-sm` | 10px | Standard buttons, inputs, menu items, tool rows, kbd |
| `--radius-md` | 12px | Menus and compact cards |
| `--radius-md-plus` | 14px | Cards and code blocks |
| `--radius-lg` | 16px | Panels and settings cards |
| `--radius-lg-plus` | 18px | Large panels and dialogs |
| `--radius-xl` | 20px | Message bubbles and the composer |
| `--radius-2xl` | 24px | Composer-adjacent prominent surfaces |
| `--radius-full` | 9999px | Pills, badges, scroll thumbs |
| `--radius-round` | 50% | Circular buttons, avatars, dots |

### 6.3 Elevation / shadows

Dark theme: elevation is expressed via **background surface layering** (bg-secondary → bg-tertiary), not box-shadow.

Light theme: minimal shadows only where layering is insufficient.

| Level | Dark | Light | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `elevation-0` | flat (bg-primary) | flat (bg-primary) | Default surface |
| `elevation-1` | bg-secondary | bg-secondary + `shadow-sm` | Cards, sidebar |
| `elevation-2` | bg-tertiary | bg-tertiary + `shadow-md` | Hover, dropdowns |
| `elevation-3` | bg-tertiary + border-accent | bg-white + `shadow-lg` | Dialogs, overlays |

Sidebar footer: a transparent utility band with no separator. The Settings,
Plugins and notification icon buttons stay grouped on the left. The
build/version chip is right-aligned and remains the update check/release entry
point. Hover and active states use semantic sidebar surfaces; neither side adds
a persistent card fill.

Every scroll container in the renderer uses one quiet scrollbar: 6px,
trackless, with a thumb that is transparent at rest. The thumb appears only
while the pointer is over the owning scroll region, the region contains the
keyboard focus, or the region is scrolling (the renderer marks the scrolling
element with `data-scrolling` for 300ms after the last scroll event, so wheel,
trackpad, keyboard, and pinned-follow scrolls all reveal it); it strengthens
under the pointer and while dragged. Scrollbars are styled only through the
`::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-elements. Partials never set `scrollbar-width` or
`scrollbar-color`, because WebKit and Chromium then ignore the pseudo-elements
and the surface falls back to an always-visible native bar. Reserved gutters
(`scrollbar-gutter: stable`) stay where layout needs them; they are simply
empty at rest. Sidebar lists use this same rule without a narrower or darker
override, so the navigation tree, conversation, and work-panel scrollbars
remain visually consistent on Windows as well as macOS and Linux.

The preload-owned document for a docked or detached plugin panel applies the
same 6px contract and scroll-reveal mark. This keeps first-party surfaces such
as the Files view aligned with the host renderer; the external page loaded
inside the Browser guest remains page-owned and keeps its own scrollbar style.

The expanded sidebar is a fixed 275px column. Collapse/open changes only whether
the column is present; the historical resize handle is hidden and legacy width
preferences are not persisted.

The profile menu is `280px` wide, opens `8px` above the footer, and uses the
standard opaque elevated-menu surface, subtle border, and dialog shadow. Its
first block repeats the local identity with the same glyph and two-line text,
followed by a divider and compact Settings / Logs / Theme rows.

Toolbar rows are 46px. macOS places traffic lights at `{x:16,y:16}` and keeps
the expanded sidebar's Collapse sidebar icon button right-aligned
in that same row. The macOS row omits the sidebar logo/title, reserves `76px`
on the left for native chrome in windowed mode, and reclaims that padding in
fullscreen. Windows/Linux keep the identity and sidebar actions in their first
row and reserve the rightmost 120px for three frameless-window controls. The
controls retain 112px of full-height hit targets, while the outer band adds an
8px visual buffer before adjacent work-panel actions. The band paints an opaque
`bg-primary` surface so page content never shows through the controls, and its
leading and bottom edges use the same `border-subtle` rule as the adjacent
titlebar so the 46px chrome reads as one continuous surface. Main, Settings,
and work-panel drag regions must terminate before this reservation rather than
overlap it and rely only on descendant `no-drag`, so every visible control
pixel remains clickable. Termination is geometric: a region ends where the
element's border box ends, so an element that only pads its content clear of
the band still covers the controls with its rectangle. The open work-panel
header uses a horizontally scrollable tab strip with a fixed `+` add trigger;
each tab owns its close action and the header does not add a second `×` beside
the native Windows close control. The band
floats over the destination pages, so on Windows/Linux a page frame and any
right-edge detail sheet start below it instead of placing their own header
actions or close control under the window controls. No application menu is
rendered inside the window.
Other menu popovers use the standard opaque elevated-menu surface, `radius-sm`,
subtle border, and dialog shadow; they are never translucent over readable
content.

All renderer-owned custom dropdowns and menus are viewport-fixed floating layers:
they are body-portaled (or use the shared anchored-menu primitive), measured
before reveal, clamped to the viewport, and repositioned when the anchor or
viewport moves. Opening one never adds to or squeezes its parent layout. The
work-panel header has no dropdown: its `+` action creates a real New launcher
tab, and the tool choices live in that tab's body. Native plugin surfaces such
as Browser therefore keep their full measured bounds while the user creates a
new page or selects another tab.
Native `<select>` popups remain OS-owned and are outside this renderer
contract.

Composer elevation (Codex `elevation-prominent`):

- soft: `0 3px 7.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.039)` + `0 0 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.051)` (Codex `#0000000a` / `#0000000d`, both themes)
- no stroke (D297): the composer lifts by shadow alone; `--ds-elevation-stroke` remains a token for floating layers only

Shadow token values (light theme only):

```text
shadow-sm:  0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)
shadow-md:  0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
shadow-lg:  0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)
```

### 6.4 Border rules

In-flow surfaces draw no strokes (D297). Structure inside a page comes from
three tonal layers plus spacing, and the border tokens are reserved for
floating layers where an edge is an elevation cue rather than a partition.

| Layer | Token | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Page | `--ds-bg-primary` | The route or dialog body itself |
| Tile | `--ds-tile` (3.5% text mix); hover `--ds-tile-hover` (6%); deep `--ds-tile-deep` (8%) | Panels, list rows, cards, form fields, chips, code blocks, empty states |
| Raised | `--ds-raised` + `--ds-raised-shadow` | The active pill of a segmented control, a disclosed detail block, a recorder keycap |
| Dock | `--ds-bg-dock` (the column), `--ds-bg-dock-raised` (its header and viewer strips) | The work-panel column and the bars inside it. Both are tokens, not literals, so a contributed theme can move them (D419) |

Every surface colour the shell paints must come from a token. A
`:root[data-theme="light"]` override that writes a literal raises specificity
above the base token rule and does not read a variable, so it silently pins that
surface out of every theme's reach — see D419.

| Context | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Row / section separators | Spacing (4–6px gap between tile rows, 12–24px between sections); never a rule |
| Card / panel outlines | `--ds-tile` fill, no ring, in both themes |
| Selection (theme, language, level) | Deeper tint or raised pill plus the existing check mark; no selected border |
| Floating layers (menus, popovers, dialogs, tooltips, toasts, hover cards) | `0 0 0 0.5px border-default` + shadow on the container; no rules inside |
| Focus rings | accent tint, 2px box-shadow |
| Control affordances (switch off-ring, resize handles) | Allowed; they are the control, not a partition |

## 7. Iconography

### 7.1 Icon set

- **Primary:** Lucide (SVG, MIT license, 24×24 default grid)
- **Alternative:** Heroicons v2 (outline variant)
- Never mix both in the same surface — pick one per implementation file
- **Never use emoji as icons** — emoji are text content, not UI affordances

### 7.2 Sizing

| Context | Size | Stroke width |
|---|---|---|
| Inline with text | 16px (1rem) | 1.5px |
| Buttons, toolbar | 20px (1.25rem) | 2px |
| Empty states | 48px (3rem) | 1.5px |

### 7.3 Color rules

- Default: `text-secondary`
- Hover/active: `text-primary`
- Accent actions: `accent` color
- Disabled: `text-muted`
- Never use colored icon backgrounds in buttons (no icon circles/squares)

## 8. Motion

### 8.1 Duration scale

CSS custom properties on `:root` (D146):

| Token | CSS variable | Duration | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `duration-fast` | `--motion-duration-fast` | 150ms | Hover transitions, color changes |
| `duration-normal` | `--motion-duration-normal` | 200ms | Expand/collapse, slide-in, toast/dialog enter |
| `duration-slow` | `--motion-duration-slow` | 300ms | Panel transitions, boot splash enter |

Interactive surfaces should reference these variables instead of hard-coded
millisecond literals when practical.

### 8.2 Easing

CSS custom properties on `:root` (D146):

| Token | CSS variable | Curve | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ease-out` | `--motion-ease-out` | `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` | Default enter / hover / fill transitions |
| `ease-in` | `--motion-ease-in` | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)` | Exit animations (toast out, splash out) |
| `ease-standard` | `--motion-ease-standard` | `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` | Continuous progress indicators (boot bar) |

- Enter animations: `ease-out`
- Exit animations: `ease-in`
- Spring-like for drag/releases: **not in MVP** (use `ease-out`)

### 8.3 Startup splash (boot feedback)

While Electron bootstrap is not yet ready, the renderer paints a full-window
**startup splash** (`StartupSplash`, `data-testid="startup-splash"`) instead of
plain status text:

- Brand mark (`BrandLogo` 64px), shell name, and tagline from the active catalog
- Accessible status copy via `app.starting` (screen-reader only) with
  `role="status"` / `aria-live="polite"`
- Soft indeterminate progress bar as loading feedback (≤1.1s loop)
- Minimum visible time ~420ms on normal motion to avoid a flash on fast boots
- Exit: 280ms opacity fade (`startup-splash-out`) once `ready` is true, revealing
  the already-mounted shell underneath
- Reduced motion: near-zero enter/exit and a static full-width bar
- macOS: the splash is the same glass as the sidebar (D304 / D348) — the
  `--ds-sidebar-glass-tint` fill plus top/bottom sheen over the native
  `sidebar` vibrancy, so the boot surface never flashes an opaque panel
  ahead of the translucent sidebar. The mounted shell stays hidden under
  the glass until the exit fade, then cross-fades in. Other platforms keep
  the opaque `--ds-bg-primary` fill

This is boot-state feedback, not decorative chrome.

### 8.4 Overlay / floating surface enter

Dialogs, search spotlight, and modal backdrops use shared enter keyframes:

- Scrim: `overlay-in` (opacity, `--motion-duration-normal` / `--motion-ease-out`)
- Dark theme scrim stays ~45% black; light theme uses ~28% `#1a1c1f` so white
  dialogs do not sit under a heavy veil (D148)
- Centered surface: `surface-in` (fade + 8px rise + slight scale)
- Top-anchored surface (search): `surface-in-top`

Toast enter/exit keep the existing removal contract (`animationend` on
`toast-out`) while using the motion tokens and a slightly softer scale.

### 8.5 Reduced motion

All motion tokens must respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

Boot splash, overlay/dialog enters, running-status pulses, and continuous bars
are also explicitly suppressed or collapsed to a static state.

> See also [09-interaction-patterns.md](09-interaction-patterns.md) §10.

### 8.6 Prohibited motion

- No parallax
- No continuous background animations (particles, waves); the bounded
  foreground mascot loop is the explicit empty-home exception
- No shimmer/skeleton animations longer than 1s loop — use simple fade-in for loading states
- No bounce effects
- No multi-second boot theatrical sequences; splash exits as soon as ready (+ min dwell)

### 8.7 Responsive interaction feedback

High-frequency workstation feedback must remain compositor-friendly and bounded:

- Destination surfaces, the work panel, jump-to-latest control, and inline
  error notices enter once with `opacity` plus a maximum 8px
  `transform`/`scale` offset using `--motion-duration-normal` and
  `--motion-ease-out`.
- Icon, navigation, message-action, tab, sidebar tool, and standard button
  controls provide a subtle pressed scale while active. The base transition
  includes `transform`, so press and release never snap; hover styling never
  changes element dimensions or surrounding layout.
- Composer focus lifts by 1px with a restrained token-based shadow. Its
  near-opaque surface must not use backdrop blur: transcript updates beneath a
  blur layer would force avoidable repaint/compositing work while streaming.
- Inline chat error notices wrap long provider detail and keep their actions
  reachable without introducing horizontal page overflow.
- Stream-driven updates never restart route or shell animations. Every enter
  effect is mount/state-transition feedback, not a response to token arrival.
- Sidebar and work-panel dock transitions animate their allocated `width` and
  `flex-basis` together with the bounded opacity/transform offset. MainChat must
  reflow continuously during the 150–200ms transition, never jump to the final
  dock width before the first painted frame.
- Replaceable streamed message/tool partials may be coalesced until the next
  animation frame; terminal, permission, planning, and error states flush first
  and remain synchronous.
- Reduced-motion mode keeps every state change and scroll destination but uses
  near-zero animation durations and instant rather than smooth programmatic
  scrolling.

## 8.0 Home empty stack and bottom composer (D111/D204/D206)

Empty composer placeholder guidance is scoped to the current page and session:
home starts with `chat.placeholderHome` and thread-docked starts with
`chat.placeholder`. Within that context the copy remains stable. Switching
between home/session views or active conversations advances through the localized
command/file hint (`chat.placeholderHomeHint` / `chat.placeholderHint`) and the
keyboard hint (`chat.placeholderShortcut`). It does not rotate on a timer or
because focus, draft, or IME state changes. The visible copy uses an opacity
fade and remains legible on the light and dark composer plates.

Empty chat home keeps the content and composer in separate vertical regions
inside `home-main-content` (D111/D204/D206; supersedes the D047 dual-grow portal
model):

- Column `flex: 1; min-height: 0; overflow: hidden`
- Inner scroller (`.home-scroll`) is the only vertical overflow surface for
  the hero and optional checklist
- Stack (`.home-stack-inner`) uses content width **`min(100%, 768px)`** in the
  expanded shell and **`min(100%, 640px)`** while the sidebar is collapsed,
  with **`gap: 16px`** (workstation ceiling), and auto margins to center the
  column when the viewport is tall
- The content order is **hero → optional onboarding checklist**. Task entry
  starts directly in the bottom composer; no starter prompt grid or contextual
  quick-action row is rendered (D204/D206).
- Short windows (`max-height ≤ 760px`) top-align the stack and keep every
  content block reachable by scrolling; the bottom composer remains visible
  and never covers the checklist
- The home composer is a bottom-reserved sibling of the scroller. Thread mode
  keeps its absolute bottom dock and reserves its measured height without a
  full-width fade veil
- Composer radius uses Codex `radius-3xl-base` (**20px** / `1.25rem`)
- Empty-home composer height is content-driven: a one-line draft renders the
  compact shell, grows with the draft through seven visible rows, and then
  keeps the shell stable while the textarea scrolls internally
- The light sidebar has no standalone New task row; scoped session-creation
  controls remain icon-only and use the semantic hover wash
- Empty hero title uses `var(--ds-text-primary)` (light override `#1a1c1f`);
  never hardcode light ink for shared hero styles
- Empty-home branding stays quiet: the 100px eight-frame mascot GIF is the
  sole animated hero mark. Light and dark themes each use a dedicated asset
  pair. It loops a short wave with an idle hold so the composer remains the
  primary task surface. Pointer hover does not change the cadence; reduced
  motion shows the matching still first frame.
- Night home composer plate styles are **dark-scoped only** (elevated-primary
  `#212121f5` + standard elevation-prominent)
- Empty draft row keeps **one visible line / 28px optical minimum** so the
  placeholder remains visible; it auto-grows to seven visual lines and
  scrolls internally from line eight onward
- Home and thread-docked prompt rows stay free of leading brand icons so the
  draft aligns directly with the input gutter. Light placeholder ~`#525355`
- Disabled send is a **solid gray chip** (`#8e8e90` light, white arrow), not
  opacity-only fade
- Floating composer plates use one solid semantic surface with no internal
  gradient: `--ds-bg-composer` in light and elevated-primary in dark. A
  hairline stroke plus the restrained `--elevation-prominent` shadow provides
  separation; the transcript reserves the measured dock height instead of
  painting a full-width gradient veil.
- Dark elevated shell reads as elevated-primary (`#212121f5` / gray-800 96%)
  on `#181818` with standard elevation-prominent
- Starter cards use a two-column grid at workstation widths and collapse to
  one column below 620px. Each card uses a subtle border, a small icon plate,
  a localized title/description, and a quiet arrow affordance; hover/focus
  uses the shared hover fill, border, shadow, and motion tokens.

## 8.1 Composer transient file references

The passive project / Local / branch rail remains removed under D095. When the
draft references files, a transient wrapping row appears inside the composer
above the textarea. Each quiet text chip uses the inset surface, a subtle
border, a file glyph, an ellipsized leaf name, and a focus-visible remove
action. No references means no reserved row or extra composer height. The
canonical path is tooltip/accessibility metadata and never textarea body copy,
including after unanswered smart-stop restoration. Dispatch and persisted user
messages still carry the canonical path required by D124. After send, the
transcript paints those same references as composer-matching leaf-name chips
rather than full-path text (D320).

Large text pastes use a second presentation: text-only input at or below the
configured `largePasteThreshold` remains native editor content, while input
above it is written as UTF-8 under the active session's scratch `pasted/`
directory and rendered as one sentinel-backed `pasted-text-*.txt` chip at the
paste caret. The chip remains atomic until the user clicks it or presses
Enter/Space; the composer then reads the bounded text file, replaces the
sentinel at its current position with editable text, removes the reference, and
places the caret after the inserted content. A failed or unsupported read keeps
the chip in place. The renderer resolves any remaining sentinel references
exactly once immediately before dispatch. The threshold is an AI → Defaults
setting, defaults to 600 characters, and applies only to text-only pastes;
clipboard files and images retain their chip presentation. Word's mixed
`text/plain` plus generated `image/*` copies selects the text representation
when the text is not whitespace-only and no file has a native path. That text
uses the same threshold. Native files, non-image files, and image-only or
whitespace-plus-image pastes retain their chips.

## 8.2 Composer runtime controls

The composer renders only controls connected to the active pi session:

- Agent / Plan / Goal updates the durable session mode and changes the next pi
  toolset. Plan and Goal are contract states of the same Agent.
- The model trigger shows only the active model ID. Its menu selects a
  configured provider/default-model pair for the active session and links to
  Agent.
- The right toolbar exposes one combined model × reasoning trigger immediately
  before the standalone prompt-enhancement Sparkles action and Send/Abort. The
  trigger shows a Bot icon, the current model, and reasoning level; `off` omits
  the level text. Its single `role="menu"`
  popover opens above the trigger at `bottom: calc(100% + 8px)` and starts with
  exactly two current-value entries. Each entry replaces the menu contents
  in-place with a back row and its submenu. The Model submenu contains search
  plus sticky provider groups. Each model row begins at one tab stop beneath
  its provider heading, making the provider → model hierarchy legible without
  altering the model label. The Reasoning submenu contains only the selected
  provider's real `supportedThinkingLevels` with a selected-row check. Selecting
  either value returns to the root without dismissing the popover.
- While the active session is running, the draft and runtime controls stay
  editable as next-turn choices; only Send is disabled. Host configuration
  remains pinned for the in-flight turn and the latest queued choice is
  persisted after its terminal event. Pending approval still blocks editing.
- File, photo, and appshot controls remain hidden until their payload contracts
  are implemented end to end.
- The combined model × reasoning menu persists changes to the active session and
  returns to its root after a selection. It renders the levels enabled by the
  selected model binding; published catalog levels seed that binding, while
  Settings can explicitly configure a level for an unknown or proxied model.
  Unknown models do not gain reasoning automatically. Changing provider clamps
  or resets the durable session value before the next turn.
- The left-of-input Composer Agent/Plan/Goal chip is the sole active-session mode
  control and cycles Agent → Plan → Goal → Agent. The Composer-right combined
  chip owns model and reasoning changes; the top bar has no duplicate mode or
  model control. The combined Composer picker closes and is disabled while an active
  `pending` Plan or Goal approval exists;
  terminal proposal snapshots do not disable it. The approval selector remembers
  the last selected mode on this device and uses it for the next pending proposal.
  Live Host events update the latest checkpoint or
  execution status retained for the current renderer lifetime. A renderer
  reload rehydrates only a pending row through `plans.pending`; terminal cards
  are not restored.

## 8.3 Global plugin launcher

`Option + Space` on macOS and `Alt + Space` on Windows/Linux opens a centered,
frameless 620×440 utility window on the display nearest the pointer. The surface
has no close, minimize, maximize, resize, or taskbar controls and dismisses on
blur or Escape. Its solid elevated token surface works in light and dark themes
without a backdrop blur. Electron starts loading the hidden launcher as soon as
the runtime is ready, in parallel with application boot, so the first shortcut
invocation reveals an already-rendered surface rather than waiting for a new
renderer process and document load.

The focused search field filters enabled, ready plugins that contribute a panel.
Chinese display names match their original characters, tone-free full pinyin,
and pinyin initials; plugin IDs, names, and descriptions remain searchable.
Arrow keys move the active option, Enter or click opens the existing sandboxed
plugin panel, and IME composition keystrokes never navigate or dispatch. The
launcher remembers which plugins were opened most recently in renderer-local
device storage and shows an empty query in most-recently-used order; a typed
query still ranks relevance first and uses recency only as a tiebreaker.
- Local and branch context are non-interactive status labels; the project name
  remains an action because it opens the project picker.
- Runtime chip labels (Agent/Plan/Goal, Thinking, permission mode, model ID) use
  `--text-sm` with `--leading-compact` inside the 28px hit target. They must not
  use `leading-none` with overflow clipping: descenders on glyphs such as
  `g`/`y`/`p` stay fully visible. Long model IDs still truncate horizontally via
  ellipsis without crushing the line box (D150).

## 8.3 Thinking disclosure

- Assistant thinking renders before the final answer as a lightweight inline
  disclosure aligned with tool activity rows: transparent transcript surface,
  Sparkles cue, rotating chevron, secondary text, and a subtle left rule only
  around expanded reasoning. It uses semantic theme and focus-ring tokens in
  light and dark modes; it must not introduce a separate inset card.
- The latest thinking disclosure opens while a thinking-only response is
  streaming and closes when the turn settles if it was not touched. A manual
  toggle owns the disclosure and remains effective through later deltas and
  completion.
- The trigger is a button with `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and localized
  Show/Hide labels. Collapsed reasoning is hidden from focus and accessibility
  traversal; reduced-motion mode disables the running marker pulse and
  disclosure transitions.
- Thinking never enters the answer bubble, answer copy action, transcript
  minimap excerpt, or searchable answer text.
- A thinking-only stream opens the transcript surface without an empty answer
  bubble or a duplicate Working indicator.


## 9. Z-index layers

| Layer | Z-index | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `z-base` | 0 | Default content |
| `z-sticky` | 10 | Sticky headers, topbar |
| `z-dropdown` | 20 | Dropdown menus, select popovers |
| `z-overlay` | 30 | Tooltips |
| `z-dialog` | 40 | Settings and confirmation dialogs |
| `z-toast` | 50 | Toast notifications |
| `z-command-palette` | 60 | Command palette overlay, body-portaled menus/popovers |
| `z-devtools` | 100 | DevTools overlay (non-production) |

Rules:

- Never use `z-index: 9999` or similar arbitrary high values
- Each layer is a fixed offset; no custom z-index outside these layers
- Stacking within a layer uses DOM order, not higher z-values
- Browser-preview and plugin views are native surfaces composited above every
  renderer layer, so no `z-index` in the table above can raise a popover over
  them. A body-portaled popover clamps to the conversation pane, which ends
  where the work panel begins, instead of to the viewport.

## 10. Layout shell metrics

These metrics define the AppShell frame. See [08-component-spec.md](08-component-spec.md) for component detail.
Codex parity decisions (D034/D070) supersede any older value here.

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Titlebar row height | 46px | Codex toolbar rhythm (D034); traffic lights {x:16,y:16} |
| Sidebar width (collapsed) | 48px | Icon-only rail |
| Sidebar width (expanded) | 275px | Fixed column; collapse/open does not resize it |
| Main pane minimum readable width | 450px | The MainChat hard floor; the sidebar yields before it is breached (ADR 0238) |
| Work panel width (closed) | 0px | Hidden by default |
| Work panel width (open) | `≥244px` (new-profile default 360px), capped by `client width - 450px - expanded sidebar` with no fixed pixel cap | the panel is an in-flow column whose width is taken from the existing client area; the renderer owns its divider (ADR 0033 / ADR 0151 / ADR 0238); saved widths remain unchanged |
| Composer shell minimum | ~80px | One-line draft + toolbar padding |
| Composer toolbar | MainChat `≥450px` | Left/right control groups stay on one row and do not shrink; mode/permission labels stay single-line and ellipsize |
| Composer draft height | 1–7 text lines | Auto-grow; internal scroll beyond line 7 |
| Chat message max width | 720px assistant / 560px user plate | Prevent eye-span over-stretch; user turns stay compact |
| Window min width | 1040px | Enforced by Electron for the whole app; opening the panel never changes native bounds |
| Window min height | 700px | Enforced by Electron |

An open work panel is a fixed-width in-flow column inside the existing client
area (ADR 0033 / ADR 0151). Its flex allocation comes from MainChat, but MainPane
retains a 450px hard minimum and the panel's effective maximum is the remaining
client width after the expanded sidebar and that floor (ADR 0238). When the
budget is exhausted the expanded sidebar collapses immediately, and the shared
budget keeps counting it while `sidebar-out` occupies flex space. Side-dock
allocation therefore cannot paint over or claim MainChat's floor. The renderer's
measured panel rect continues to position the native Browser view. Opening and
collapsing do not request a positive native reservation or change persisted
window bounds. Before
collapse motion starts, any native Browser preview surface is detached because
it cannot participate in renderer CSS animation; macOS, Windows, and Linux
retain the fade-and-slide exit.

Preview mode is a transient shell state: MainChat is unmounted and the work
panel occupies the client width beside the sidebar. A window-level 46px chrome
row owns the drag area, New Task/sidebar actions, and native window controls.
Collapsed-sidebar preview reserves 76px on the left for macOS traffic lights in
windowed mode and 8px in fullscreen. The maximized panel header retains that
native reserve, then adds the preview action lane and an 8px gap before its
first tab.

### 10.1 Responsive collapse

- The work panel never participates in responsive collapse. It keeps its
  committed preferred width of at least `244px` (new-profile default 360px)
  while visible, capped by the shared budget; saved widths remain unchanged.
- The inner panel divider changes the panel width in the renderer. Moving it
  left takes internal space from MainChat until the 450px floor is reached, at
  which point the expanded sidebar yields; moving it right returns that space.
  Native window edges resize only the fixed app window.
- Panel open and collapse change only the in-flow flex allocation. No positive
  native reservation is requested, and the panel's preferred width remains a
  renderer-local setting.
- The outer shell keeps native edge/corner resizing enabled on every platform.
  Frameless titlebar drag regions never replace the OS resize ownership. A
  300ms stable-bounds settle window prevents recovery logic from competing with
  a slow pointer gesture, and normal base bounds persist 600ms after the last
  native resize/move event. Width < 1040px or height < 700px is unsupported and
  prevented by Electron.

## 11. Component foundations

These are **token-level foundations** for common primitives. Detailed component specs are in [08-component-spec.md](08-component-spec.md).

| Background | bg-tertiary (dark); bg-slate-800 (light) |
| Text | text-primary |
| Delay | 300ms show, 100ms hide |
| Max width | 240px |

### 11.8 Toast

Full component contract and usage rules: [08-component-spec.md §17](08-component-spec.md#17-toast).

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Position | top-center viewport, 16px from the top edge, `width: min(360px, 100vw − 32px)` |
| Surface | `bg-elevated-opaque` + 1px `border-subtle` + `shadow-dialog` (same family as floating menus) |
| Radius | radius-md-plus |
| Font | text-md, leading-compact-plus |
| Variants | `info` / `success` / `warning` / `error` — 16px Lucide status icon tinted with the semantic token; surface stays neutral (restraint principle) |
| Duration | 4s auto-dismiss; error 8s; `duration: 0` = sticky; hover pauses the timer |
| Stack | vertical, max 4 (oldest dropped), newest nearest the top-center anchor pushing older down; identical message+variant re-raises restart instead of stacking |
| Dismiss | X button on every toast (`toast.dismiss` i18n label) |
| Motion | enter 200ms ease-out slide-down/fade, exit 150ms ease-in fade; reduced-motion → near-zero duration (not `none`, removal listens for `animationend`) |
| Z-index | z-toast (50) |

## 12. State patterns

### 12.1 Interactive states

| State | Background | Text | Border | Cursor | Motion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Default | per variant | per variant | per variant | default | — |
| Hover | bg-tertiary or accent-hover | text-primary | — | pointer | 150ms |
| Focus | — | — | 2px accent ring offset-2 | default | — |
| Focus-visible | same as focus (only on keyboard focus) | — | 2px accent ring offset-2 | default | — |
| Active/pressed | accent bg, text inverted | text-primary (inverted) | — | pointer | — |
| Disabled | bg-secondary | text-muted | border-subtle | not-allowed | — |
| Loading | same as default + spinner | text-secondary | — | wait | spinner 1s rotate |

### 12.2 Semantic states

| Semantic | Indicator | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Success | icon ✓ or green dot | success token |
| Error | icon ✗ or red dot + inline message | error token |
| Warning | icon ⚠ or amber dot | warning token |
| Running | spinner (neutral) + pulsing border-left | accent token |
| Pending | dimmed + clock icon | muted token |
| Denied | red outline + "Denied" label | error token |

### 12.3 Streaming indicator

- Running agent: transcript working feedback + subtle pulse on the left border of the latest assistant message; the topbar remains free of a duplicate status dot
- Completed: spinner replaced by success icon for 2s, then fades
- Error: spinner replaced by error icon, persistent until dismissed

## 13. Content density rules

| Rule | Application |
|---|---|
| **Base padding 8px (space-2)** | Default inner padding for list items, form groups |
| **Message gap 10px** | Between chat message rows — denser WorkBuddy-like transcript |
| **Section gap 16px (space-4)** | Between distinct UI sections (sidebar sections, settings groups) |
| **Panel gap 0px** | Panels touch edge-to-edge with border-subtle separator — no gutters |
| **Compact list rows 28px height** | Sidebar session items, settings list rows |
| **Button rows 32px height** | Standard buttons |
| **Never exceed 24px vertical gap** | Even for "breathing room" — this is a workstation |
| **Max content width 720px** | Chat messages, tool disclosure rows — prevent over-wide eye-span |

## 14. Do / Don't

### Do

- Use semantic tokens (`text-primary`, `bg-secondary`) — never raw hex in component code
- Use `font-mono` for all code, file paths, tool arguments, terminal output
- Provide visible focus rings on every interactive element
- Test contrast ratios: **4.5:1 minimum** for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Keep motion under 300ms and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Collapse long content by default (tool results, long messages) — see [09-interaction-patterns.md](09-interaction-patterns.md) §4
- Use Lucide/Heroicons SVG icons — never emoji as UI affordances
- Use compact padding and tight spacing — developer density, not consumer spacing
- First launch follows the system theme (see §Theme switching); dark is the primary design target

### Don't

- Don't hardcode `#181818` or any hex value in component JSX — use tokens
- Don't use emoji as icon substitutes (🚀, ✅, ❌ are text, not UI icons)
- Don't add decorative gradients, glass-morphism, or neon effects
- Don't use `z-index` values outside the defined layers
- Don't animate for decoration — motion is feedback only
- Don't set `font-size: 16px` as base — 14px is the workstation default
- Don't use large hero images or marketing-style empty states
- Don't apply rounded corners to full-width panels (sidebar, topbar)
- Don't use `border-radius: 0` on buttons and inputs (use `radius-sm` minimum)
- Don't show raw API keys in any UI surface

## 15. Acceptance criteria

1. All color tokens defined as CSS custom properties with Tailwind `@theme` mapping
2. Dark and light themes render correctly with ≥4.5:1 contrast on all text/background pairs
3. `system` theme follows `prefers-color-scheme` without white-flash on dark startup
4. Typography uses Inter (sans) and JetBrains Mono (mono) with defined fallback stacks
5. Base font size is 14px; no component defaults to 16px body text
6. All interactive elements have visible `focus-visible` rings using accent color
7. All motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
7b. Boot shows the branded startup splash until ready, then exits smoothly
8. No raw hex color values in React component source (only token references)
9. Z-index usage confined to defined layers (no arbitrary values)
10. Layout shell metrics (topbar, sidebar, composer) match spec values in CSS
11. Icon components use Lucide/Heroicons SVG — no emoji icon affordances
12. Spacing values use the defined scale (no arbitrary pixel values in component code)
13. Stream updates do not retrigger destination/shell enter motion or a
    backdrop-filter repaint behind the composer
14. Expanded sidebar session titles, project/group titles, and empty-state copy
    use the 13px compact token without changing the 28–32px row pitch

## Dark floating surfaces (Codex parity)

- Main surface: `#181818` (`gray-900`)
- Sidebar / surface-under: `#000000`
- Floating composer plate: Codex elevated-primary (`#212121f5` / `color-mix(gray-800 96%, transparent)`) with standard elevation-prominent (`0 0 0 .5px` stroke + `0 3px 7.5px #0000000a` + `0 0 20px #0000000d`); no heavier night-only lift
- Light workspace chips capsule: elevated gray `#f4f4f4` (not pure white-on-white)
- Combined workspace chips: elevated translucent plate over main, not flat main gray
- Stage Manager: host re-asserts min bounds while collapsed (permanent watchdog)

## Destination pages

- **Project archive**: the D066 Codex index table (search / expand / actions)
  is embedded in Settings with no duplicate page title or outer page padding;
  the earlier standalone Projects destination and card grid (D042) are
  superseded by D133. Per D267 the destination is composed exactly like the
  agent capability pages (D257): a quiet description-only intro line, one
  toolbar (sort segment, search, primary action), and one elevated panel whose
  Pinned / All projects / Archived groups are in-panel header strips carrying
  the only counts on the page. It has no hero block, no decorative gradient,
  and no page-level counter run
- **Settings**: full-page Codex shell per D063/D090/D133/D166 (275px compact
  eight-destination rail, `#f4f4f4` light, elevated content cards, Back to app);
  per D092, the content cards fill the pane width available from the current
  window instead of retaining D070's fixed 720px cap — the earlier in-shell
  200px rail and broad grouped directory are superseded
- Light destination cards use white elevated plates (not flat gray fills)
