# 06. Settings Information Architecture

## 1. Settings root (Codex full-page shell)

Settings is a **full-window page** that replaces the app sidebar + main chrome (Codex electron behavior):

- Settings remains usable when an unrelated startup read fails: a successfully
  loaded settings snapshot is retained independently from the remaining
  bootstrap data. If the settings read itself is unavailable, the content pane
  shows a compact loading/failure state with a retry action instead of an empty
  section.

- Left settings rail only (sidebar surface `#f4f4f4` light / `#000` dark), **~275px** (Codex gold at 1200-wide)
- Top of rail: traffic-light clearance and the pill **Search settings…**
- The **Back to app** (`返回应用`) action is pinned to the foot of the rail, not
  the top: it keeps its chevron + label form as a 32px control, and it shares
  the horizontal band of the main shell's sidebar footer icon row (settings /
  plugins / notifications), so the action does not jump vertically when the
  full-page takeover opens or closes. The directory above it scrolls when the
  window is too short for every destination, so a pinned action never covers a
  row
- The 46px top band is a native window drag region across both the rail and the
  content pane, but it is drawn in two parts so each keeps its own surface: the
  rail drags via its own top strip on the rail surface, and the content pane's
  band starts at the rail edge on the primary surface. The band must never paint
  the primary surface over the rail, which would show two colors in one top row.
  Interactive controls remain explicitly non-draggable
- A compact navigation directory with short, parallel labels and icons, in this
  exact order:
  1. **General / 常规** — Lucide `SlidersHorizontal` (appearance)
  2. **AI** — Lucide `Sparkles` (permissions, defaults, command shell)
  3. **Shortcuts / 快捷键** — Lucide `Keyboard` (keyboard shortcuts)
  4. **Instructions / 指令** — Lucide `FileText` (global and project instruction files)
  5. **Models / 模型** — Lucide `Bot` (providers and default model)
  6. **Skills / 技能** — Lucide `BookOpen` (reusable agent instructions)
  7. **MCP** — Lucide `Server` (agent connections)
  8. **Subagents / 子智能体** — Lucide `Bot` (built-in and personal parallel agents)
  9. **Import / 导入** — Lucide `Download` (bring sessions and model configuration in from other tools)
  10. **Projects / 项目** — Lucide `Archive` (durable project index)
  11. **Info / 信息** — Lucide `Info` (versions, logs, updates, developer)
  Icons are decorative (`aria-hidden` via the SVG default) and stay monochrome
  with the rail label; do not reuse refresh/rotate glyphs here.
- The directory remains a flat searchable list in the same exact order. For
  scanability, the destinations are shown in four titled visual clusters:
  `Preferences` / `偏好` (General, AI, Shortcuts), `Agent` / `智能体`
  (Instructions, Models, Skills, MCP, Subagents), `Workspace` / `工作区`
  (Import, Projects), and `System` / `系统` (Info). Headings are muted,
  non-interactive labels and use whitespace for separation; no divider lines are
  rendered. These are visual landmarks only, not a second navigation level.
  When search filters the directory, empty clusters and their headings disappear.
- No additional settings destinations or placeholder navigation rows are shown
- Main content pane on primary surface with large section title + elevated
  rounded cards of rows. Its content uses the full width available after the
  fixed rail and pane gutters, and resizes continuously with the window.

## 2. Section contents

### General
- **Appearance** card:
  - **Theme**: a searchable picker row (same anchored-menu pattern as
    Language). The trigger fills the settings control column and shows the
    current name. The menu pins System, Light, and Dark at the top, then lists
    plugin themes after a divider with a "Provided by …" hint. Search matches
    labels, descriptions, ids, and plugin ids. Selection updates
    `settings.theme`.
  - **Language**: a searchable picker row (not a card grid). The trigger fills
    the settings control column and shows the current native name, or Match
    system. The menu pins Auto at the top with the detected language inline
    (e.g. "Currently 简体中文"), then lists every shipped locale with its
    native name (endonym, never translated) and English name for search and
    sort. Selection updates `settings.language`. Adding a locale is a catalog
    plus a registry row; the picker does not hard-code the option list.
  - **Font**: a searchable picker row (trigger shows the current family rendered
    in that face) offering the System default, bundled open-licensed families
    (Geist, Inter, Noto Sans SC, LXGW WenKai — SIL OFL 1.1, shipped locally),
    and installed system families enumerated by Electron main; selection
    persists as `AppSettings.fontFamily` and applies to the global UI stack
    (`--font-sans`) without a reload; System default clears the override;
    long system lists are windowed so only the visible slice is in the DOM
    (bounded font loading) and opening the picker never blocks input
  - **Font size**: Starbucks-style cup presets (Tall / Grande / Venti /
    Trenta) plus a
    percentage slider (80%–150%). Cup labels stay on one line. Selection persists as
    `AppSettings.fontScale` (`1` = product ramp; absent means 1). The
    renderer sets `--font-scale` on the root so every `--text-*` step and
    shared Lucide icon scales in proportion without a reload. Window Zoom
    In/Out/Reset stays independent. The UI never asks for a px value
    (D343 / ADR 0180)
  - **Auto language detection** resolves the OS locale through the main process
    (`app.getLocale()`) rather than the renderer's `navigator.language`, and the
    Auto option shows the detected language inline (e.g. "Currently 简体中文")
  - native select triggers and their opened option lists use the active theme's
    readable foreground/background pairing on macOS, Windows, and Linux; the
    shared native-select contract applies to every app surface
- **Network** card:
  - **Proxy**: a segmented control — System, Direct, Custom. System is the
    default and lets Chromium follow the OS proxy; Direct disables the proxy;
    Custom applies one HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5 URL to app-owned outbound
    traffic (model calls, marketplace, updates, model catalog, plugin
    `net.fetch`, and the in-app browser). Workspace Bash and the system
    browser used for OAuth are not rewritten.
  - Custom shows a Proxy URL field (`socks5://127.0.0.1:1080` /
    `http://127.0.0.1:7890`), a Bypass list defaulting to
    `localhost,127.0.0.1,::1,<local>` so loopback MCP and local models stay
    direct, and a Test action that issues one Chromium fetch through the
    draft proxy. The URL is validated on blur; invalid schemes are rejected.
  - The selection persists as optional `AppSettings.networkProxy`
    (`mode` / `url` / `bypass`). Absent means System. No host protocol or
    storage schema version bump (D340 / ADR 0177).
- Platform-specific **Close behavior** remains in General because it changes
  application-window behavior rather than agent behavior.
- File-open target, menu-bar behavior, and bottom-panel behavior are not
  rendered until their host-backed settings schemas and runtime effects exist.

### 全局 AI (`ai` tab)
- **Permissions** card: the global permission-mode control
  (ask / accept-edits / auto) that governs how autonomously the agent acts.
- **Defaults** card: the host-backed default operating mode (Agent / Plan / Goal),
  command shell selection, Link open destination, context usage display
  (remaining or used), Enter-to-send control, and the large text paste
  threshold. Link open destination uses the Work panel browser by default
  and can route plain HTTP(S) link clicks to the system browser. Context
  usage display controls whether the composer toolbar context ring and its
  popover lead with the remaining or the used capacity figure; the default
  is remaining. The threshold controls when a text-only paste becomes a
  temporary session-scratch file; it defaults to 600 characters and accepts
  integer values from 1 through 1,000,000.
- The **Command shell** row in Defaults uses the host-discovered catalog of native
  PowerShell 5.1, PowerShell 7, cmd, Git Bash, and Bash with IDs
  `windows-powershell`, `windows-pwsh`, `cmd`, `git-bash`, and
  `bash` where supported. The selected `defaultCommandShell` persists across
  restart; writes reject unavailable or wrong-platform IDs. If a persisted
  choice later becomes unavailable, the first available platform shell is used
  and the fallback state is shown. When the selected shell is available, the
  selector is the only configured-state indicator; status text is reserved for
  the default, fallback, and no-effective-shell cases. A Bash turn verifies its
  pinned ID/dialect before execution.
- Context management has **no card and no controls** (D200 / ADR 0061, kept by
  D203 / ADR 0064). Automatic protection is always on and its budgets and
  retention limits are derived from the active model's window, so there is
  nothing a user could tune from here — the reference implementation does not
  expose these values either. Settings search indexes no compaction keys.
  Manual `/compact` remains available from the command palette for an idle
  session; the transcript shows where each compaction happened and the context
  usage inspector shows whether a checkpoint is installed.

Token usage is **not a Settings destination** (D335 / ADR 0173). Completed-turn
history stays host-owned (`session.endTurn.usage`, `stats.getTokenUsageHistory`).
The user-facing dashboard is marketplace plugin `pi.token-insights`, opened from
the command palette (`usage`, `tokens`, `用量`). Settings search does not index
a usage tab.

### Shortcuts (`shortcuts` tab)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** card:
  - lists navigation, agent, and window actions from one shared shortcut map
  - renders platform-native modifier labels (`⌘` on macOS, `Ctrl` on
    Windows/Linux) and the platform-specific full-screen default
  - clicking a binding records the next modifier chord or `F1`–`F12`; `Escape`
    cancels recording
  - each binding can be explicitly set to `Unbound`; the disabled state remains
    editable and is distinct from restoring the default
  - duplicate application bindings and operating-system/editor-reserved chords
    are rejected with an inline error; an unbound action never participates in
    conflict checks
  - each override can be restored independently and all overrides can be
    restored together
  - overrides persist in optional `AppSettings.keybindings`; a missing entry
    uses the platform default, a valid string uses the custom binding, and
    `null` disables the action. macOS native-menu accelerators and
    renderer-owned shortcuts update from the same map
  - the plugin launcher defaults to `Option + Space` on macOS and `Alt + Space`
    on Windows/Linux; its native global registration follows the same override.
    An unbound launcher disables Electron registration, the Windows host hook,
    and the focused-window fallback

### Model configuration (`agent` tab)
- **Defaults** card: a compact settings row shows the provider name and exact
  model ID beneath the Default model label. A quiet Change action opens the
  picker without duplicating the current value. The picker groups model-level
  options by provider, marks the exact current entry, and keeps its searchable
  list bounded. Account labels are not appended to model IDs. Global operating
  mode, command shell, and Enter-to-send are owned by the AI destination.
- **Vendor accounts** card (D237/D240), between Defaults and Providers:
  - the card lists accounts, not vendors: one row per local OAuth provider row,
    including multiple rows for the same vendor. Its list surface uses the same
    single-level panel and row structure as AI services. The whole section is
    hidden when the runtime catalog offers no OAuth vendor
  - a primary Add account action in the card header opens every OAuth-capable
    vendor; existing accounts do not remove or disable that vendor from the
    picker, so the same vendor can be added again for a different account
  - an account row shows the vendor name, a Subscription badge where the access
    is plan-backed, a Connected or Needs sign-in badge, and the account label.
    Duplicate accounts receive a stable account number in the row; the default
    model remains available in Defaults and the account editor
  - picking a vendor opens a single dialog that renders whatever the flow asks
    for — an opened browser with a copyable link, a device code, a choice, or a
    text field — with a cancel action that aborts the local callback server or
    the polling loop. Plain text prompts submit their trimmed value, including
    an empty string when the vendor defines it as the default (for example,
    GitHub Copilot's blank Enterprise URL means github.com).
  - Remove account is a destructive, two-step action. It deletes that account's
    OAuth credential and provider row, clears or repairs the global default when
    needed, and leaves other accounts from the same vendor untouched
  - Edit account opens a dialog carrying the account label plus the same
    two-pane model picker the AI service dialog uses (D270): the account's
    discovered/entitled models on the left, the chosen bindings on the right
    with per-model context window, max output, and seven thinking-level chips
    behind the Advanced disclosure, so model selection is identical for both
    credential kinds. Published levels seed known models; explicit selections
    remain user-owned. The account has no API key field and discovery
    resolves the stored OAuth login instead. Saving updates the OAuth provider
    row and keeps the global default model in sync when that account is selected
  - Test connection resolves the account's OAuth authorization and reports a
    transient success or failure without probing the provider with an API key
- **Providers** studio:
  - OpenAI-compatible and custom-service add-provider dialog (opened from Add
    provider / empty-state CTA)
  - provider cards with host, first configured model, secret status,
    and test / make-default / delete actions
  - Add account and Add provider use the same primary button treatment
  - the add/edit dialog configures connection identity (name, endpoint, API
    style, and secret). It shrinks to the overlay on a narrow window, and a
    focused credential field keeps its 2px accent ring inside the dialog
    instead of clipping against the scrolling body. It then selects one or
    more models from a searchable multi-select catalog. The discovered-list
    header has a checkbox that selects or clears every currently visible row,
    including when a search filter is narrowing the list, and a Fetch list
    action that re-probes the service immediately. Each selected model has an independent, compact
    configuration row for context window, max output, supported thinking
    levels, and the default thinking level. The row keeps the model ID,
    source, capabilities, and token limits visible at a glance, and expands
    in place for edits. The expanded body is a compact sheet, not a stacked
    form dump: 2xs labels, dense numeric fields without native spinners, the
    alias hint as a title tooltip rather than a paragraph, the default
    thinking selector on the thinking label row, and attachments plus
    subagent delegation on one wrapping row. The first row starts expanded so the form remains
    discoverable; additional rows stay collapsed to keep large model sets
    scannable. The bundled models.dev release snapshot pre-fills known rows; custom IDs
    absent from it use the runtime generic values. The portaled
    option list can scroll without dismissing the picker; scrolling an
    outside settings container dismisses it before the trigger can become
    detached. Search results keep a dedicated no-match state instead of
    reusing the search placeholder.
  - each model option and configuration row shows a compact text/vision
    capability state. Settings compares the checkbox with the published model
    record, while the Composer badge and runtime use the effective binding:
    absent or `null` `supportsImages` follows the published value, and an
    explicit `true` or `false` overrides it. An unknown model remains
    conservative unless its configured binding explicitly enables image input.
  - model discovery is debounced after a valid endpoint, key, or API style
    change, including no-auth/local endpoints; named add-path discovery waits
    for an API key (editing reuses the stored secret) and does not mark
    loading until the debounce fires; the picker remains usable with
    free-form custom model IDs when discovery is unavailable
  - thinking chips always render the seven canonical levels in canonical order.
    Published levels seed known-model bindings, while a row with no published
    reasoning shows all chips unselected with a concise manual-override hint.
    This lets a compatible proxy or newly released model be enabled explicitly;
    the saved binding, not the catalog, owns the effective selection. A row the
    catalog does not describe — a hand-typed ID, a vendor-account model, or an
    endpoint that went quiet — still keeps its stored selections, so discovery
    being unavailable can never erase configuration.
    The label, optional hint, and default selector sit on one row above one
    compact grouped control that spans the pane; the seven options share the
    width equally and wrap only when the pane is narrow.
    Removing the current default falls back to the first enabled level; no
    enabled levels disable the default selector and show the model's
    manual-override hint
  - a new dialog starts with only **Service**. Named endpoints from
    models.dev (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Groq, xAI,
    Mistral, Together, Fireworks, OpenCode Go, Z.AI, DeepSeek, Qwen/DashScope,
    Moonshot/Kimi, Zhipu, SiliconFlow, Volcengine Ark, MiniMax,
    MiniMax (OpenAI), Xiaomi, Kimi
    For Coding) then show Service + API key, with the published host as a
    one-line summary. Custom endpoint then shows Service, Name beside Base URL,
    and API key beside API format in three explicit rows so each input keeps a
    stable alignment as the form changes. The custom Base URL field accepts
    only http(s) service base URLs and trims pasted operation paths such as `/models`,
    `/messages`, `/chat/completions`, or `/responses` when the field loses
    focus. The placeholder is enough — no helper paragraph under the URL.
    Invalid URLs show an inline error and block discovery and save. A failed
    model-list probe shows a compact classified error in the empty pane, or a
    one-line banner above a cached list; raw HTTP/JSON dumps are not shown.
    Named display names and optional custom headers stay behind Advanced settings.
    The dialog header's upper-right actions include an explicit Advanced settings
    button that opens a separate compact modal, keeping the main form focused on
    the endpoint and model panes. The modal uses the header close action only;
    it does not render a footer action row. The modal offers common presets including a
    ready-to-use User-Agent, copies the same normalized header record used for
    persistence as pretty-printed JSON (blank names omitted, last write wins),
    and imports either a direct JSON header map or
    `{ "headers": { ... } }`; imported keys merge case-insensitively without
    duplicating existing rows. The editor keeps at most five header rows visible
    and scrolls internally for additional rows. Empty headers keep adapter
    defaults.
    Service is a searchable anchored menu of vendors (filter by localized
    name, vendor key, alias, or host), not a native select, region grouping,
    stepper, or vendor-card grid. Saved named rows store the models.dev `vendorKey` and
    the preset `apiStyle` (Chat Completions, Responses, Anthropic, Gemini, or
    `opencode_go`).
    A saved row carrying an unknown or legacy API style remains editable; the
    form shows the Chat Completions fallback and can repair the value on save.
  - helper copy stays out of the model cards; labels, status badges, and the
    empty/error state carry the necessary context without explanatory
    paragraphs
  - empty state with primary add action
  - API keys are never shown raw after save
  - vendor-account rows are not rendered in the AI services list; a connected
    vendor account can still be selected in Defaults and is managed only in the
    Vendor accounts card

The permission-mode selector remains available in the composer while the
session is in Agent, Plan, or Goal. In Plan and Goal it controls Bash
confirmation only: Ask and Accept edits prompt, while Auto may run a mutating
Bash command without confirmation. The AI Defaults card must describe that both
contract modes are intent boundaries, not strict read-only security profiles.

### Agent capability destinations (Skills / MCP / Subagents)

Skills, MCP servers, and user-owned Subagents remain three independent
destinations under the Agent group. They share a capability-management visual
system while preserving their different data ownership:

- Each capability page starts with a quiet, page-specific description and a
  short scope note on one shared line rather than a decorative hero or alert.
  Light and dark themes use the shared Settings surface, typography, borders,
  and semantic tokens; capability pages do not introduce a separate color
  system.
- Each page is one workbench, not a stack of per-level sections (D257): a
  single toolbar above a single elevated panel. The toolbar carries the level
  filter as a segmented control with live counts (All / Global / Project), one
  search field with a clear affordance, the selected-project picker, and the
  page's primary actions right-aligned. Subagents omits the filter and the
  picker because it is global-only, keeping only search and its actions.
  The panel still uses two in-panel groups: **Built-in** (the five shipped
  definitions `explorer`, `code-reviewer`, `test-runner`, `fixer`, and
  `ui-designer`, rendered as read-only rows) and **Global**
  (`~/.agents/subagents`, user-owned). An enabled user document of the same
  name shadows that builtin in the Task catalog, so the Built-in row is omitted
  while the user row remains. A disabled user document of the same name leaves
  the builtin in the catalog (and on the Built-in list) because Task uses the
  shipped definition again. Built-in rows carry a source badge and
  **Copy as mine** (opens the create sheet pre-filled from that definition, with
  the matching template chip selected); they have no enablement switch, reveal,
  or delete because they are not files.
- The level filter narrows which groups the panel renders; it never hides the
  toolbar or moves the actions. New capabilities are created at the level the
  filter points at — Global under All or Global, Project under Project — and
  the primary action's tooltip names that destination so the choice is never
  implicit. Choosing Project without a selected project reports that instead
  of failing silently.
- Inside the panel, each level is a group header row — level name, resolved
  `.agents` path in mono, localized count — followed by its rows. Lists flow
  at natural page height like every other Settings surface; the page scrolls
  as one document instead of nesting fixed-height scroll wells.
- Rows follow the provider-row rhythm: a quiet muted icon, name, a level badge
  plus any source/transport badges, single-line description, optional mono meta
  (MCP target, subagent tool grant), then the row actions. Every row carries
  its own level badge so a row scrolled away from its group header still says
  where it lives. MCP expresses connection state only through a small status
  dot inside the state badge — the only color on an otherwise monochrome row.
  Disabled rows dim their icon and copy while keeping the switch fully legible.
- Row actions are Edit, an overflow menu, and the enablement switch. Edit and
  the overflow menu stay quiet until the row is hovered, focused, or has its
  menu open; the switch is always visible because enablement is the state the
  list is read for. Without hover the quiet actions are always shown. The
  overflow menu holds the level-aware destructive and out-of-app actions —
  Reveal and Remove for skills and subagents, Test connection and Remove for
  MCP — and Remove arms on first press, relabels to ask for confirmation, and
  disarms on its own if the menu is dismissed or left alone.
- Skeleton rows appear on first paint only. A later refresh keeps the rows it
  already has and dims the list instead, announcing the refresh to assistive
  technology, so toggling a switch never replaces the list with skeletons.
  Enablement flips locally first and reverts only if the host refuses, and
  busy state is scoped to the row that is working — one pending request never
  disables the rest of the page. Empty states are quiet centered
  glyph-and-copy blocks inside the panel; an empty level offers the same
  primary action rather than being a dead end, and a search with no matches
  says so and suggests widening the level filter.
- When the viewport is narrow the toolbar stacks: the segmented control spans
  the width with evenly divided segments, search sits below it, and the
  actions wrap left-aligned. Group headers drop the resolved path so row copy
  keeps the width.
- Skills exposes a Market action beside New / Import. Market is a second view
  of the same page, not a new Settings destination: browse catalog sources,
  preview the assembled markdown (including inlined sibling `.md` files), and
  install through `skills.create` into `~/.agents/skills`. Built-in picks are
  English-titled offline fallback. Default GitHub sources are queried with
  user-added sources; a remote badge uses `sourceId`, not id collision with
  builtin rows. Documents that would exceed the 128 KiB host cap cannot be
  installed. Back reloads the skill list.
- The Subagents create/edit sheet pins a model with a searchable, provider-
  grouped anchored menu — the same option-menu control the service picker uses
  — over the configured, runnable models the Composer offers, plus an
  inherit-session option. A native `<select>` cannot serve this list: an
  install can configure dozens of models, and only an anchored surface scrolls
  inside itself and accepts a filter. Its thinking selector offers inherit-session,
  do-not-send, and the seven canonical levels. Every option comes from the
  configured provider catalog, so the sheet never accepts a hand-typed model
  id; when no provider offers a runnable model it shows an empty state whose
  action opens Models.
  A pin that is no longer configured remains visible so editing does not
  silently drop it. The stored frontmatter value is still
  `vendorKey-or-name/modelId`; generic or colliding provider aliases use a
  unique display name, then the stored provider id, to keep each provider's
  choices distinct.

- The selected model-configuration thinking chip uses a solid accent fill with
  inverted primary text in both light and dark themes, so the enabled level is
  visually distinct from the track.

- Subagents open one **New subagent / Edit subagent** sheet that
  pre-fills the same fields the runtime's `BUILTIN_SUBAGENT_DOCUMENTS` ship
  with. Above the name field the sheet shows a "Start from template" row of
  compact name chips (Explorer, Code reviewer, Test runner, Fixer, UI
  designer, plus a blank option). Chips show the localized name only; the
  selected chip's one-line caption sits once under the row. Hyphenated preset
  ids (`code-reviewer`, `test-runner`, `ui-designer`) resolve through an
  explicit catalog map (`presetReviewerName` / `presetTestRunnerName` /
  `presetUiDesignerName`) — they must not be
  turned into keys by capitalizing the first letter. Picking a chip
  replaces the draft's description, tools and body wholesale and
  clears inherit-parent-tools. The tool grant row includes an inherit checkbox
  (`tools: inherit`) plus the seven assignable tools; inherit-only drafts may
  leave the assignable boxes empty. Saving must keep the inherit token.
  The chip uses the same accent-tint pill as the tool grant row. Create
  omits the long subtitle and the per-chip Apply label; model, thinking,
  output limit and scope sit behind an Advanced disclosure that
  starts closed on create and open on edit. The output limit caps one delegate
  response (issue #171). It defaults to an empty field, which reads as "follow
  the model" rather than "no limit" — empty is the only spelling of that, so
  the placeholder is the model default and not an unlimited label. It is
  separate from the model binding's Advanced **Max output** because the binding
  caps every caller of that model, while this caps one delegate's own
  responses. The model field
  is a picker over the configured providers' models; the picker groups entries
  by provider and every option comes from the configured catalog, so there is
  no hand-typed pin entry (issue #60). With no providers configured it shows
  an empty state whose action opens Models. Builtins stay on the existing
  read-only Built-in rows; the picker is for new and user-owned subagents
  only.
  The create/edit sheet stays compact at desktop sizes: form controls are
  local filled wells with restrained padding, the prompt editor is the only
  intentionally tall control, and Advanced remains a compact disclosure. Hover
  and focus lift a control without adding a persistent in-flow divider; invalid
  form state is announced from the shared error region.

### Instructions (`instructions` tab)
- Edit the global instruction Markdown used by every PI-Desktop Agent session.
- Show the resolved instruction-file path and save through the host-backed
  instruction API; project instructions remain managed from the active project
  menu and are resolved after the global layer.

### Import
- Scan supported local agent stores for **sessions** and **model configuration**
  through two independent cards on the same destination. Neither scan runs
  automatically (D007 / D342).
- Sessions: review candidates through `SessionImportPanel`. Source and
  project-path grouping behavior follows
  [08-component-spec §18](08-component-spec.md#18-sessionimportpanel)
- Model configuration: review provider drafts through
  `ModelConfigImportPanel`
  ([08-component-spec §18.5](08-component-spec.md#185-modelconfigimportpanel)).
  Stored API keys from those configs are copied into the host secret store;
  subscription/OAuth logins are not copied. CC Switch (`~/.cc-switch`) is
  scanned as its own source so saved profiles, not only the currently
  applied live file, can be imported. Re-importing an equivalent provider
  (same normalized base URL, API style, and credential) is skipped; profiles
  with different credentials at one endpoint remain separate. If the app has
  no default model yet, the first newly created provider becomes the default.

### Project archive
- Reuses the durable Projects index as a settings-scale management surface
- Always includes archived records; archived rows are grouped, never hidden, so
  the destination still has no visibility toggle
- Supports project search, add, activate, project-session expansion, pin,
  archive/restore, and close
- A successful session import bound to an archived project restores that
  project's renderer presentation state after the session refresh, making the
  imported session visible in the default sidebar. Ordinary refreshes and
  skipped imports preserve the archive choice.
- Add project opens the Create project dialog. The user supplies a display name
  and can select multiple local folders in one native picker; the first folder
  is the primary root of one logical project, and the remaining folders are
  retained as roots of that same project rather than separate project tabs.
  Chats, project instructions, and project memory are shared by the group.
- The destination is one workbench, not a stack of bands (D267, revising D168):
  a quiet intro line above a single toolbar above a single elevated panel. It
  reuses the same composition, control height, and row rhythm as the agent
  capability pages (D257) and adds no page-specific chrome.
  1. **Intro line** — one quiet description line, the same shape as the
     capability pages' intro. The destination shows no page-level totals: there
     is no hero block, decorative gradient, counter banner, or inline counter
     run. The per-group counts on the panel's header strips are the only totals,
     so a number is never repeated in two places
  2. **Toolbar** — one row carrying the Recent/Name sort as the shared
     segmented control, the search field with a clear affordance and a match
     count while searching, and the primary Add project action right-aligned
  3. **Panel** — one settings panel holds every group. The always-visible
     sections run Pinned, All projects, Archived as non-interactive in-panel
     header strips, each carrying its label and row count. Every section is a
     labelled region wrapping its own list, so the strip is never a non-list
     child of a list and each row keeps its group name in the accessibility
     tree; rows follow with hairline separators. Empty sections are omitted,
     and an index with no rows renders one quiet in-panel empty state instead
     of the panel groups
- Row anatomy: disclosure control, color glyph, project name with state tags
  (Active, Open, pinned tag, Archived), one meta line carrying the shortened
  monospace path, branch, and session count, a relative last-active time, and a
  hover/focus-revealed action pair (New task, row menu). The colored glyph uses
  Folder for ordinary projects and a filled Star for pinned projects, while the
  pinned tag remains as the localized text cue.
- The row menu groups create/edit actions above pin, archive/restore, and the
  destructive Close action, and closes on Escape or any outside press
- The row menu includes Project memory. Its editor is a compact viewport-level
  dialog with a list of editable memory cards. Each card supports an optional
  title, multiline content, and removal; the dialog also supports adding
  entries, shows an empty state, and keeps Cancel/Save actions. Saved entries
  are scoped to that project's path and are available in later chats for the
  project.
- Project search also matches session titles. Matching a session retains and
  expands its owning project; expanded sessions are ordered by latest activity,
  show a count and relative update time, and reveal additional rows in batches
  of eight rather than silently truncating the history
- Activating a project or project session returns to chat; archive and close
  actions keep Project archive open even when the active workspace changes

### Info
- app/host/protocol versions + open logs
- **Report a problem** row: one action opens the GitHub bug issue form in
  the system browser. Electron Main owns the URL (`pi-desktop/app/openFeedback`),
  prefills app version, OS, and environment from Main-owned version info, and
  never accepts a renderer-supplied destination (D313 / ADR 0157)
- Updates row with the current delivery state and one applicable action:
  Check for updates, View release, or Restart to update
- **Developer** card:
  - developer mode is off unless the optional persisted
    `AppSettings.developerMode` value is `true`
  - the developer mode switch unlocks the Open console button, F12 on every
    platform, Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows/Linux, the macOS View-menu developer
    tools item, and Copy conversation ID / Open session path on the
    conversation overflow menu
  - disabling developer mode closes an open console and disables or removes
    every entry point; Settings search indexes the card, switch, and console
    action
- The Updates row always exposes a Release notes action. It opens a modal
  containing the complete shipped stable changelog in newest-first order,
  localized to the product language and marking the current and available
  versions when present
- When an update is available, downloading, or downloaded and Main attached
  localized product notes, the Updates row shows a compact "What's new"
  list under the status text (same notes as the ambient banner; D164). The
  full-history modal remains available when the app is up to date or update
  checks are disabled in development

## 3. Navigation rules

- Profile footer / command palette open Settings full page (default General)
- Composer model menu and provider setup actions deep-link to the Providers
  card inside Agent
- Plugin management remains available from the app shell's independent
  **Plugins** destination, including load, enable, disable, and uninstall; it is
  not duplicated in Settings
- The marketplace source selector lives inside **Plugins → Marketplace**, next
  to the catalog controls; it is not a separate Settings destination.
- Project archive is indexed by Settings search and is not duplicated as a home
  sidebar destination or standalone global-search page
- Back to app returns to chat shell from the rail's pinned footer action

## 4. Acceptance

1. Opening Settings hides the coding app sidebar (full-page takeover)
2. Rail shows the search pill at the top, the back-to-app action pinned at the
   foot on the main sidebar's footer icon line, and exactly General / 常规, AI,
   Shortcuts / 快捷键, Instructions / 指令, Models / 模型, Skills / 技能, MCP,
   Subagents / 子智能体, Import / 导入, Projects / 项目, and Info / 信息 in
   that order. The rows are grouped under Preferences / 偏好, Agent / 智能体,
   Workspace / 工作区, and System / 系统. There is no Usage / 用量 destination.
3. Appearance is part of General and has no standalone rail destination
4. Providers is part of Agent and has no standalone rail destination
5. Plugins has no Settings destination; the app-shell Plugins page supports
   load, enable, disable, and uninstall
6. General shows the host-backed Appearance card; the AI destination shows
   Permissions and Defaults, including the Command shell row; the
   Shortcuts destination shows the Keyboard shortcuts card; Info shows the
   Developer card. No additional settings destinations are rendered. Token
   usage lives in plugin `pi.token-insights`, not Settings.
7. Provider secrets never display raw key values
8. Model configuration shows compact Defaults, separate vendor accounts, the
   account edit/add dialogs, and AI service cards rather than a dense always-on
   form dump
9. Row descriptions use semantic secondary text and maintain at least 4.5:1
   contrast against their card surface in both light and dark themes
10. Dragging the empty top band from either side of Settings moves the native
   window without blocking Back, search, or navigation controls
11. Resizing the window expands or contracts the content cards with the
    available content pane; the fixed rail and pane gutters remain intact and
    the page does not gain horizontal overflow
12. Project archive always exposes archived records and can restore them without
    duplicating the index in the app shell
13. Project archive renders one quiet description line — no hero, banner, or
    page-level counter run — above one search + sort toolbar and one panel
    containing the Pinned / All projects / Archived group strips; each strip's
    count agrees with its rendered rows, sorting reorders rows inside every
    section without hiding any, and clearing the search restores the complete
    index
14. Info renders disabled, checking, up-to-date, available, downloading,
    downloaded, and error update states without adding another destination
15. Native select option lists remain readable in both light and dark themes,
    including when Chromium delegates the opened list surface to Windows; the
    same global rule covers non-Settings native selects
16. Shortcut recording rejects modifier-free non-function keys, reserved
    editor/OS chords, and conflicts; successful overrides immediately drive
    app behavior and macOS menu accelerators and survive restart
17. Developer tools remain unavailable by default; enabling developer mode
    unlocks the localized Settings action and platform shortcuts, persists
    across restart, and disabling it closes an open console
18. Context management exposes no settings at all; protection is always on and
    its budgets scale with the active model's context window, so no persisted
    value can leave a small-window model uncompactable or the guard disabled
19. The default operating-mode selector contains Agent, Plan, and Goal; legacy
    Chat values migrate to Plan and do not reappear as a selectable option
20. Command shell selection persists a platform-valid catalog ID, exposes
    status only when it adds information (default, unavailable, fallback, or no
    effective shell), and never authorizes a stale ID/dialect
21. Skills, MCP, and Subagents each render one toolbar above one panel; the
    level filter changes which groups appear without hiding the toolbar or the
    primary actions, and the counts on the segments agree with the rows the
    panel renders under the active search
22. Each capability page can create, edit, and delete a capability without
    leaving Settings; new capabilities land at the level the filter points at,
    the primary action names that destination, and choosing a project level
    with no selected project reports it instead of failing silently
23. Removing a capability requires two presses of the same menu item, the
    second press labelled as the confirmation, and the arming lapses on its own
    if the menu is dismissed
24. Revealing a project-level skill opens that project's file, not a global
    file of the same id
25. Toggling one capability leaves every other row interactive, does not
    replace the list with skeletons, and restores the previous switch position
    if the host rejects the change
26. Info exposes a Report a problem action that opens the GitHub bug form
    with version and OS filled in; Settings search indexes the row
27. The Skills page Market view browses public-HTTPS catalogs, previews
    the assembled document, and installs only through `skills.create`; oversized
    expanded documents are refused and source badges follow `sourceId`

## 5. General chrome metrics

The shell retains the Codex gold chrome while allowing the content pane to use
the current window width:

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Rail width | ~275px (`--ds-settings-nav-width`, shared by the rail and the top band inset) |
| Rail light bg | `#f4f4f4` |
| Top band | content pane only, inset by the rail width; rail keeps its own surface |
| Active nav pill | denser 6px/10px pad, ~8px radius, gray mix on rail |
| Section title | 28px / 560, first baseline ~y70 |
| Content width | Full available pane width after rail and gutters |
| Card radius | ~14px elevated stroke |
| Toggle | **32×20** thumb 16, neutral accent on (not green) |
| Open-target pill | leading VS Code glyph |
