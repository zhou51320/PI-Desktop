## 1. Keyboard shortcuts baseline

### 1.1 Global shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `Option + Space` (macOS) / `Alt + Space` (Windows/Linux) | Open plugin launcher | OS-global after application boot; customizable |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` | Open command palette | Global (D014) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + N` | New chat/session | Global |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + O` | Open project | Global |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + W` | Close window | Global |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + ,` | Open settings | Global |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + B` | Toggle sidebar | Global |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + J` | Toggle work panel | Global; active session |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + [` | Previous destination | Global |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + ]` | Next destination | Global |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + .` | Abort active turn | Global (same as abort button) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + K` | Open command palette | Global |

### 1.2 Conversation context shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `Enter` | Send message when Enter-to-send is on; newline when it is off | Composer focused |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Send message when Enter-to-send is off | Composer focused |
| `Shift + Enter` | Newline | Composer focused |
| `Alt + Enter` (`Option + Enter` on macOS) | Steer the current turn; send normally when idle | Composer focused, outside IME composition |
| `Escape` | Clear input / blur composer | Composer focused |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + ↑` | Scroll to top of transcript | Transcript focused |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + ↓` | Scroll to bottom of transcript | Transcript focused |

### 1.3 Command palette shortcuts (within palette)

| Shortcut | Action | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `↑ / ↓` | Navigate results | Palette open |
| `Enter` | Execute selected command | Palette open |
| `Escape` | Close palette | Palette open |

### 1.4 Shortcut rules

- macOS application-menu shortcuts are discoverable through system-menu
  accelerators. Windows/Linux shortcuts remain available without rendering an
  application menubar; command-only shortcuts are discoverable via command
  palette search (keyword "shortcut" or "keybinding").
- Shortcuts must not conflict with macOS system shortcuts or common browser shortcuts
- Never override `Cmd/Ctrl + C`, `Cmd/Ctrl + V`, `Cmd/Ctrl + A`, `Cmd/Ctrl + S`
- Shortcuts are consistent across macOS (Cmd) and Windows/Linux (Ctrl)
- A missing shortcut override uses the shared platform default; a valid
  string uses the custom binding; an explicit `null` means `Unbound` and never
  dispatches. Unbound actions do not conflict with other bindings.
- A modifier-only keydown and an IME composition/229 keydown never dispatch a
  command. Repeated keydown events do not repeatedly traverse destination
  history; each back/forward chord advances at most once per physical press.
- Command-only shortcut changes require updating the command palette metadata;
  native roles and visible application-menu accelerators remain menu-owned
- The plugin launcher is registered through Electron's native global shortcut
  API. Windows' reserved default `Alt + Space` additionally uses a host-core
  low-level keyboard hook that consumes the system-menu chord and emits an
  Electron host notification, so it works while another application is
  focused. A focused-window fallback remains available if the hook cannot be
  installed. An unbound launcher disables both the hook and focused-window
  fallback. Custom bindings continue to use Electron's global shortcut API.
  Electron starts warming the launcher in a hidden window as soon as Electron
  is ready, in parallel with backend and main-window boot; shortcut delivery
  during warm-up joins the same in-flight load. The macOS show path relies on
  the panel's normal activation instead of issuing a second application
  activation or window-stack move. The launcher always opens on the display
  nearest the pointer.

### 1.5 Plugin launcher shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `↑ / ↓` | Cycle matching plugins | Launcher focused |
| `Enter` | Open selected plugin panel | Launcher focused, not composing IME text |
| `Escape` | Dismiss launcher | Launcher focused |

The launcher opens with an empty query and shows enabled, ready panel plugins
in most-recently-used order from renderer-local device history, so the last
opened plugin stays one Enter away. Typing still ranks search relevance first;
recency only breaks ties between equally relevant matches.

### 1.5 Platform application menus

- macOS application-menu accelerators dispatch the same allowlisted shell
  commands as renderer controls. Native Edit/View/Window roles retain
  platform text-editing, zoom, fullscreen, hide, and quit behavior.
- Windows/Linux render no application menu in the window. Their frameless
  titlebar keeps sidebar actions at the left edge and native window controls at
  the conversation pane's right edge while the work panel is closed. While the
  work panel is open, those controls stay viewport-fixed at the window's right
  edge over the panel header, which reserves the control band plus the
  work-panel toggle so resource close remains reachable. The sole panel
  collapse control is that viewport-fixed toggle. Destination history has no visible back/forward
  controls and remains available through the renderer shortcuts. The first
  transcript row starts below the 46px titlebar control band so user and
  assistant content cannot overlap the minimize, maximize/restore, or close
  targets. Destination pages and the plugin detail sheet start below the same
  band, so page header actions and the sheet close control never stack under
  those targets. F10 and Shift+F10 are not consumed by shell chrome.
- Windows/Linux keep New Task, Open Project, Settings, close-window,
  zoom, fullscreen, search, command-palette, sidebar, and work-panel shortcuts
  through renderer key handling. Standard editing shortcuts remain native
  web-content behavior.
- Developer tools are opt-in. With developer mode enabled, Main handles F12 on
  every platform and Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows/Linux; macOS exposes its native
  developer-tools role in View; the conversation overflow menu adds Copy
  conversation ID and Open session path. With the mode disabled these product
  entry points remain unavailable, and disabling it closes an open console.
- Main queues native commands until the renderer acknowledges that its menu
  event subscription is active on macOS. Closing and recreating a window
  resets this handshake.
- Frameless minimize, maximize/restore, and close controls remain outside the
  drag region. Maximize state is queried on mount and updated from native
  window events, so the restore affordance never depends only on optimistic
  renderer state.
- Windows/Linux explicit minimize actions use native minimize and keep the
  taskbar entry. On Windows, clicking the focused window's taskbar button also
  uses native minimize and keeps the taskbar entry; clicking it again
  restores/focuses the same window, while clicking the entry for a merely
  covered window keeps the normal bring-to-front behavior (D252 / ADR 0117).
  macOS native minimize remains tray-resident. Windows/Linux close behavior is user-configurable
  (ADR 0090): an unset preference asks once via a native prompt (Cancel / Close
  to tray / Quit); `tray` hides the window under that same tray icon, whose
  click restores the window; `quit` exits the app. Close behavior never creates
  or destroys the tray — D216 owns it, so the icon is resident under either
  choice. The choice is persisted, revisitable in Settings → General, and
  applied by both the close button and the close shortcut. Explicit quit
  (Cmd+Q, application-menu Quit, tray Quit) is a separate confirm step
  (D363): Cancel leaves the app running; Confirm runs the ordered shutdown.
  A D230 window-close Quit does not ask again. Automated boot, supervision,
  and capture probes skip the dialog, as does the restart that installs an
  already-downloaded update — its installer is already running and gives up
  when the app stays alive. macOS keeps the
  native Dock lifecycle (close keeps the app in the Dock; activating recreates
  the window). The bounds watchdog never restores a minimized or tray-hidden
  window.

### 1.5.1 Tray-resident and taskbar minimize

- Explicit application minimize means **native taskbar minimize** on Windows
  and Linux: the renderer's window-control button and native-menu minimize
  action use the normal OS transition. macOS traffic-light minimize and the
  macOS Window → Minimize role remain **hide to tray**.
- On Windows, clicking the taskbar button of the focused visible main window
  means **native minimize**. The window stays represented by its taskbar entry;
  the next click restores and focuses it. A taskbar click while the window is
  merely covered brings it to the front and does not hide it to the tray.
- Tray hiding, including a Windows/Linux close with `tray`, removes the main
  window from the taskbar/dock window list while the Electron process and
  background work remain alive. It does not persist a minimized geometry or
  dispose the host/sidecar.
- Clicking or double-clicking the PI-Desktop tray icon, choosing Show from its
  menu, or activating the app from the macOS dock restores and focuses the
  existing window. If the window was closed, the same action creates a fresh
  window.
- The tray menu is localized with the active shipped shell locale and
  exposes Show PI-Desktop plus an explicit Quit PI-Desktop action. Quit uses
  the existing ordered shutdown path. What closing the window does is the
  user's own choice on Windows/Linux (ADR 0090) and a Dock-lifecycle close on
  macOS; the tray icon itself is created once at startup either way.

### 1.6 Sidebar project and conversation organization

The sidebar is a path-keyed presentation of host-owned projects and sessions.
The `Sessions` heading appears first and contains path-less conversations plus
their create and sort controls. Its bounded list keeps standalone work visible
without consuming the full sidebar. The following `Projects` section heading
exposes the project picker above retained project groups. Several project groups
may be retained while exactly one workspace supplies the visible shell context.

#### Project tab lifecycle

1. **Open** — selecting a project from Settings → Project archive or the picker adds its
   normalized path to the retained set and activates it. Existing tabs remain.
2. **Activate** — selecting a different group calls the existing `project.set`
   bridge. Its path then drives topbar identity, active workspace state, and
   new-task scope.
3. **Collapse** — disclosure state belongs to each project path. Collapsing
   hides children only; it neither changes the selected session nor stops a
   run. The directory row is one full-width disclosure target containing its
   chevron, folder, and label: selecting an inactive directory activates it
   first, and every directory-row click toggles that group's children without
   changing any other group's state. Project actions are separate sibling
   controls and never toggle the directory.
4. **Close** — closing removes only the retained tab. If it was active, the
   last remaining tab is selected or the visible workspace is cleared. Durable
   projects, sessions, and transcripts remain.

#### Organization actions

- **Rename** — the session row menu and Project archive task rows open the same
  modal editor. Saving trims the title and persists 1–80 Unicode code points;
  blank values are not submittable. The title is metadata only, so the task's
  transcript, activity ordering, project binding, and empty-session state are
  unchanged. Escape, Cancel, or clicking the scrim dismisses the editor.
- **Edit project** — the project overflow menu in the sidebar and Project
  archive opens the same editor for the selected logical project. The editor
  trims and persists a 1–80 Unicode-code-point group name and lists every
  registered folder. The Primary folder stays first and cannot be removed;
  additional folders can be added through the native multi-selection picker or
  removed individually. Saving updates the host-owned group while preserving
  the normalized paths, workspace identity, sessions, transcripts, and on-disk
  folders. A folder with existing chats cannot be removed.
- **Pin** toggles presentation priority. Pinned projects/conversations appear
  before unpinned rows within the selected secondary order. In the sidebar, a
  pinned project replaces its Folder glyph with a filled accent Star so its
  state remains recognizable without opening its overflow menu.
- **Archive** is non-destructive. Archived rows are hidden by default,
  available through Show archived, and restorable. Archiving does not cancel
  a turn or delete a transcript.
- **Create branch** snapshots an idle conversation's complete active
  transcript into an independent session in the same project/Temporary scope.
  The command is disabled while the source runs. Success selects the child and
  focuses the composer; failure leaves the source visible and unchanged.
- Archiving the visible conversation/project first moves the visible context
  to a non-archived sibling. With no sibling, a conversation receives a fresh
  draft in the same scope and a project clears the visible workspace; the app
  never leaves a hidden archived row as the active context.
- **Sort** offers Recently updated (`recent`), Created date (`created`),
  Oldest first (`oldest`), and Name (`name`). Missing/invalid values fall back
  to `recent`. Pressing a project title and moving 8px, or ArrowUp/ArrowDown
  on that focused title, switches project ordering to `manual` and persists a
  contiguous order per normalized path. Archived and pinned priority remains
  ahead of the manual order; projects without an assigned order fall back to
  a stable path order until they are moved.
- Each project group shows the ten most-recent rows in the active sort order
  by default; the remaining sessions fold behind a **Load N more…** control
  (the same affordance used for time-grouped overflow). Selecting it expands
  the full time-grouped list, and the expanded state is per-group, for the
  current session only, and not persisted.
- Presentation changes are saved best-effort. Storage failure must not block
  project activation, session selection, or agent execution.

#### Session isolation across tabs

- Selecting a row immediately marks that destination as selected. A 120ms
  pointer hover or keyboard focus may prefetch its transcript; duplicate reads
  share one in-flight request and the renderer retains at most five recent
  transcript snapshots.
- Transcript loading starts without waiting for an older superseded selection.
  When session summary metadata is available, project activation/clearing and
  transcript IO run in parallel. A monotonic navigation generation permits only
  the newest selection to project the visible workspace, transcript, run state,
  navigation history, and work-panel context.
- The chat surface retains one pane per session, keyed by session id and bounded
  to three (the visible pane plus the two most recent). Hidden panes stay mounted
  and inert — `visibility: hidden` plus `content-visibility: hidden`, never
  `display: none`, which would discard their scroll offset — and each pane keeps
  its own scroll position for its lifetime. Switching to a session that still has
  a pane (warm) reveals it immediately with its retained content and position:
  nothing is dimmed, no skeleton appears, and no transcript remounts. If the
  destination is running or still holds a completed reply the durable page has
  not caught up to, revalidation treats the durable read as a lower-water mark
  and keeps its renderer-owned assistant/tool tail; completed durable rows may
  be added, but the partial or just-finished reply cannot be rolled back. The
  bounded durable page is stitched onto the live snapshot in chronological
  order: live rows older than that page stay before it, and an optimistic,
  streaming, or not-yet-flushed tail stays after it. Live-only rows are never
  appended after the page, which would move the newest turn out of the mounted
  trailing window (D317 / D261 / D324). Live provenance is cleared only once
  that page already contains every live row.
- Switching to a session with no retained pane (cold) leaves the visible pane on
  its own session until the destination commits. Only a thin progress track and
  `aria-busy` mark the wait, the composer stays non-interactive so a prompt cannot
  reach the session being left, and the destination session id is never paired
  with another session's messages. The destination is then revealed at its final
  record without a top-of-history or empty-home flash. An evicted session is
  indistinguishable from a first visit.
- New Task is not a cold switch. Creating a session reveals the empty home on
  the first frame (the previous conversation and retained panes clear before
  `session.create`). Reusing the group's latest empty session commits that empty
  transcript on the same frame rather than waiting for `session.get`. The
  durable row is inserted from the `session.create` summary; send and paste wait
  for that in-flight create instead of opening a second slot (ADR 0154).
- A first-opened session settles at its newest turn. A revisited pane returns to
  the offset the user left, and a pane still pinned re-anchors to the bottom;
  activation no longer resets manual-scroll state for a revisit (ADR 0137).
- Selecting a project-scoped conversation activates its project as part of the
  store-owned selection transaction. Selecting a Temporary conversation clears
  the visible workspace. Project-scoped new-session actions pass their target
  path to that same store transaction; sidebar and project-index handlers do
  not perform a second project navigation before session creation or selection.
- Run state, permission grants, and streamed events are keyed by session id.
  A project/tab switch does not abort a background turn or copy its events into
  the visible transcript. Background message and tool events update that
  session's renderer-owned live cache, so reopening a running session does not
  lose the partial tail when its durable detail read completes. Transcript
  revalidation and older-page prepends are idempotent by message id and keep the
  last version at the first row position, so reopening or a stale page response
  cannot add a second copy of a user message. These events never activate their
  session, change the visible project/page, or move
  focus. Creating a new session or switching to one that is not running returns
  the composer to its idle Send state on that first frame: a turn still streaming in the
  previously selected session never leaves the destination session's send button
  stuck in the Abort/stop state, and that background turn's later completion
  does not alter the destination composer. Their work-panel artifacts and
  Browser resource update only the
  originating session's retained renderer context and do not reveal or resize
  the visible panel. Only an explicit session/notification activation navigates
  and projects the destination session's retained panel context.
- The composer draft is also session-scoped in renderer memory (D301): the
  cache outlives any one Composer mount, so switching sessions, empty-home ↔
  docked, chat ↔ other pages, or OS windows saves/restores the source text and
  file references. An uncached destination starts empty, and the home composer
  has its own draft slot. Creating a new session does not copy another slot. A
  completed send clears only the draft belonging to the session that submitted
  it, even if the user switches sessions while the request is in flight;
  deleted sessions cannot retain drafts.
- Every tool call resolves `workspaceRoot` from the originating durable
  session, not from the currently selected project tab. Background completion
  refreshes the matching row without redirecting the active conversation.

#### Focus and semantics

- Project directory rows expose `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`;
  new-project/new-session controls have scope-specific accessible names, and
  sort/archive menu choices expose their checked state. Active session rows
  retain `aria-current`.
- Toggling disclosure or a menu action keeps focus on its control. Selecting a
  project/session returns focus to the composer after loading.
- Sort, archive, restore, pin, Create branch, and close actions remain
  keyboard-reachable;
  they cannot exist only as pointer-hover affordances.
- Sidebar body-level menus opened from toolbar or row triggers remain
  content-sized and use the same fixed rule as right-click menus: open 4px to
  the anchor's right without flipping to the left. Their surface width is
  capped for narrow viewports. This includes the Sessions sort menu,
  session/project overflow menus, and section create menus.

#### Floating dropdown surfaces

- Every renderer-owned custom dropdown/menu opens as a viewport-fixed floating
  layer, outside its triggering row or card, so opening it never changes parent
  height, width, or scroll allocation.
- Shared anchored menus are measured before reveal, clamp to the viewport,
  prefer the requested side, and recalculate on anchor movement, scroll, and
  resize. Outside press and Escape close the surface and restore focus to its
  trigger unless the pattern explicitly retains input focus.
- Native `<select>` popups remain platform-owned; this rule covers custom
  renderer surfaces only.

### 1.6 Local profile footer

- The `44px` profile trigger toggles the menu; its chevron and
  `aria-expanded` state change together.
- The `280px` menu opens `8px` above the transparent footer band. Opening it
  moves focus to the first actionable row after the non-interactive identity
  header and divider.
- `ArrowDown` / `ArrowUp` wrap among Settings, Logs, and Theme. `Home` and
  `End` move to the first and last action.
- `Escape` closes the menu and restores focus to the profile trigger. A pointer
  press outside closes it without stealing focus from the pointer target.
- Selecting Settings, Logs, or Theme closes the menu before performing the
  action. Theme applies the next theme value without reopening the menu.
- The separate `32px` Help button bypasses the profile menu and navigates
  directly to Settings → Info.
- Collapsing the sidebar closes the menu and restores the collapsed rail's
  normal navigation state.

### 1.7 Notification inbox (D117)

#### Event-to-surface flow

1. Renderer reports the current chat's session id to Electron Main; navigating
   away clears it. Main combines this hint with its own window visibility and
   focus state when a turn reaches `completed` or `error`.
2. If the exact finishing session is already visible in the focused window,
   `session.endTurn` closes the turn without inserting a notification. Any
   background session or unfocused/hidden window creates the durable record.
   An `aborted` turn never creates one.
3. Electron emits `notification.changed` to every live renderer so the bell
   badge and currently open inbox refresh.
4. For a task result, a focused main window produces no native banner. If
   it is unfocused and native notifications are supported, Electron shows one
   platform notification derived from the event kind and session title. The
   separate interactive ask/permission/plan path may alert for a focused
   background session while suppressing the exact visible session. On
   Windows, the banner is attributed to the canonical PI-Desktop
   AppUserModelID shared with the NSIS package and taskbar identity.
5. Clicking the native notification shows/restores and focuses the main
   window, then emits `notification.activated { sessionId }`.
6. Renderer activation selects the bound project when present, loads the
   session, and focuses the transcript/composer using the same path as an inbox
   row click. Native and in-app activation must not diverge.

#### Popover behavior

- The list shows `task.failed` rows only and the bell badge counts only
  unread failures. `task.completed` rows are still persisted and still drive
  the sidebar outcome badge and the native notification, but the inbox hides
  them so failures are not buried under routine completions (D295).
- Bell click toggles the non-modal popover; a second click, Escape, or outside
  press closes it. Escape restores focus to the bell.
- Opening preserves the most recently selected `All` / `Unread` filter for the
  current renderer lifetime and never marks rows read implicitly.
- Arrow keys move through rows with wrap disabled; `Home` / `End` jump to the
  first/last row; Enter/Space marks the row read and activates its session.
- Mark all read updates every unread row in one host transaction. Clear
  removes all inbox rows in one host transaction. Both operations are
  idempotent, refresh the exact unread count, and leave sessions/turns intact.
- The renderer does not synthesize notification records from stream events.
  Host-core's unique `turn_id` is the exactly-once boundary across repeated
  terminal updates, renderer reloads, and process restarts.
- All visible event labels and native title/body strings are localized at the
  presentation boundary from structured fields; persisted rows never contain
  localized prose.

### 1.8 Work panel entry and resources (D128, D142, D154, D173, D179, D207, D221)

- The shell starts without a visible work panel. The viewport-fixed toggle and
  `Cmd/Ctrl + J` both toggle the active session's panel: they reveal the
  retained context without creating a resource tab, and collapse the visible
  panel without deleting tabs, retaining tabs, active resource, and committed
  width. They are a no-op without an active session or while Settings is the
  active page. The panel's `+` trigger can then create a New launcher tab whose
  body offers Browser or an in-scope plugin view.
- An artifact trigger atomically creates or reuses its resource, activates it,
  and opens the panel. Background artifacts never open the visible panel.
- File resources use normalized paths as identity. Browser and plugin views
  are singletons; repeated triggers preserve resource order and activate the
  existing resource.
- Once open, the panel header is a `tablist` that scrolls horizontally while a
  tight `+` trigger stays fixed beside it. Each tab owns its active state and
  close button; the active tab is scrolled into view. Clicking `+` creates a
  unique New launcher tab; its data-driven Review, Files, Browser, and plugin
  view rows are ordinary buttons in the page body.
- Tab focus uses roving `tabIndex`: ArrowLeft/ArrowRight/Home/End move across
  tabs and Delete/Backspace closes the focused tab. Middle-click closes a tab;
  closing an active tab selects the right neighbor, then the left. Selecting a
  launcher row replaces that New tab with the destination or activates its
  existing singleton. Shortcut labels appear only for bindings that actually
  exist.
- Activating a tool that is already open activates its existing resource instead
  of replacing it, so Browser keeps its URL and Files its selection (D173).
- Every resource can be closed from its tab. Closing the active resource selects
  the right neighbor, then the left; closing the final tab keeps the panel open
  on the New launcher. The viewport-fixed panel toggle hides the panel without
  deleting tabs.
- On every platform, opening and collapsing the visible panel change only the
  internal flex allocation; native window bounds remain unchanged. The inner
  divider updates the renderer-owned panel target from 244px upward, capped by
  the live three-column budget, while native window edges resize only the fixed
  application window (ADR 0151).
- A successful workspace Write/Edit creates or activates Review in its
  originating session. Failed and scratch writes do not. Background-session
  artifacts update only their retained context and never open, activate, resize,
  focus, or change the visible panel.
- Each successful workspace Write/Edit tool result carries one durable review
  snapshot. Its compact InlineReviewCard is rendered in the same activity
  disclosure, immediately after its tool row; it is never moved to the
  transcript bottom and never shared with another session. Its status badge
  covers added, modified, and deleted changes, while counts and expandable
  hunks come from that message's result, not a current Git diff.
- The transcript cards and Review consume the active session's persisted
  message history. A commit, workspace focus change, or external Git state
  change cannot remove or rewrite an old card. Review is a chronological
  snapshot history and each reversible card exposes host-guarded rollback;
  conflicts are reported without replacing a later edit. Scratch, failed,
  denied, and unstructured results do not render a card. A background
  session's card remains with its own transcript and becomes visible only
  after that session is selected; its event never renders in the currently
  visible session. Successful workspace artifacts may still create or
  activate the singleton Review tab.
- Each session retains `{open, tabs, activeTabId, browserResource}` in renderer
  memory. Selecting another session swaps the visible context atomically and
  switching back restores it; selecting a workspace without an active
  conversation hides the panel. Session/workspace identity remains attached to
  every relative resource, preventing cross-context reinterpretation.
- Relaunch discards every session context, including Browser resources; only
  the committed preferred panel width persists. Native window state is stored
  independently from normal bounds, including when the app closes while
  maximized or before a pending bounds-save debounce completes. Panel width
  remains fixed rather than being responsively clamped.

### 1.9 Application updates (D120)

- Electron Main checks the fixed release feed 15 seconds after packaged app
  startup and every 6 hours afterward. Development builds remain disabled.
  The checker always tracks GitHub's latest stable release
  (`allowPrerelease = false`), so installs that still carry a prerelease
  version such as `0.2.0-rc.6` are offered the newer stable tag instead of
  staying pinned to the same prerelease channel.
- Settings → Info and application-menu checks share one typed update state.
  Manual checks expose up-to-date or error feedback; automatic failures do not
  open a toast or ambient banner.
- Manual delivery (`darwin`, non-AppImage Linux, and Windows portable runs
  with `PORTABLE_EXECUTABLE_FILE`) stops at `available` and
  offers the fixed GitHub Releases page. In-app delivery (Windows NSIS and
  Linux AppImage readiness builds) automatically advances through
  `downloading` to the stable `downloaded` state.
- `downloaded` remains actionable until Restart to update or normal app quit;
  later scheduled/manual checks do not replace it with `checking`.
- A compact update notice appears in the main pane's top-right safe area only
  for manual `available`, in-app `downloading`, or `downloaded`. It stays clear
  of the bottom composer at every supported window size and draft height. The
  notice uses a stable icon/title/message hierarchy, shows determinate download
  progress when available, and keeps the relevant action inside the same
  surface. Dismissal suppresses the current version-and-status stage; a later
  stage such as `downloaded` appears again.
- When Main attaches localized product notes for the discovered version
  (`UpdateState.releaseNotes`, D164), the notice and Settings → Info Updates
  row show a compact "What's new" list under the status message. Notes come
  from the shipped-locale changelog catalog selected by the product UI locale
  — never from a renderer-supplied feed or remote URL. Missing catalog entries
  omit the section; locale changes re-resolve notes without a new check.
- Settings → Info keeps a Release notes action available in every updater
  state. It opens a modal over Settings with the complete local stable
  changelog in newest-first order, localized from the same shared catalog.
  The current release and a discovered available release are identified with
  compact badges. The list scrolls independently, closes by its close control,
  Escape, or the backdrop, and restores focus to the invoking control.
- D126 tag releases publish all platform manifests and installers. Windows
  NSIS and Linux AppImage therefore use the in-app lane; macOS and Linux deb/rpm
  remain notify-and-link delivery modes.

## 2. Streaming message behavior

### 2.1 Token rendering

- Tokens append to the current assistant MessageBubble as they arrive
- Renderer displays runtime stream chunks directly; it does not enqueue a
  second requestAnimationFrame-driven typewriter state loop
- Rendering uses incremental markdown parse — do not re-render the entire message on each token
- Transcript reconciliation keeps completed history in a memoized history boundary;
  token updates do not reconcile each historical row in React while preserving
  the full history for selection, copying, minimap anchors, and accessibility.
- Within the active assistant turn, unchanged activity groups without Task
  delegations also keep their memoized boundary across text updates. Changed
  tool messages still render, and Task groups still receive later lifecycle
  status and completion timing updates from the same turn.
- An unfinished `mermaid` fence remains a source code block. After its closing
  fence arrives, answer prose loads and renders the diagram only when it
  approaches the viewport; thinking disclosures always retain Mermaid source.
- Diagram render failure or the 20,000-character / 500-edge safety limit keeps
  the source visible and copyable instead of failing the assistant turn.
- Cursor indicator: subtle pulsing accent dot or line at the end of streaming content
- Before the first assistant or tool event, the active turn shows one compact
  localized `Working…` status with elapsed time. When the runtime reports a
  quiet interval, that same row names the wait: starting, waiting for the
  model, preparing the next request, compacting context, recovering an empty
  response, retrying a provider request, or waiting for delegated work (with
  each running subagent's latest coarse action). It is replaced by concrete
  thinking/tool/answer feedback or the inline permission card as soon as one of
  those states exists.
- When stream completes: cursor indicator replaced by success state (2s fade)

### 2.2 Auto-scroll

- Opening a session for the first time resets follow mode and positions the
  transcript at its last record before the browser paints its pane. Revealing a
  retained pane restores that pane's own follow state and offset instead: still
  pinned re-anchors to the bottom, scrolled up returns to the same offset.
  Neither path animates through history, and no pane may ever expose the
  transcript top or another session's scroll position.
- A first open whose history exceeds the initial mount budget settles under an
  opaque skeleton veil (D287). The veil is in the same commit as the bounded
  first paint, covers the scroller but not the composer, and lifts only once the
  scroller's `scrollHeight` and `clientHeight` have read the same for three
  consecutive frames, or after a 600ms cap. Every sampled frame re-pins a pinned
  transcript, so the frame the veil reveals is already at the newest turn. The
  minimap and the jump control mount after the veil lifts. Short transcripts
  never show the veil.
- Auto-scroll to bottom on each new token group (throttled: check every 100ms, not every token)
- The first upward manual scroll movement pauses auto-scroll immediately and
  cancels any pending follow frame; small trackpad deltas must not snap back to
  the bottom
- Sending a new prompt, retrying, or regenerating always re-pins follow mode and jumps to the bottom before the turn continues, even if the user had scrolled up
- "Scroll to bottom" floating button appears as soon as manual upward scrolling
  releases follow mode
- Click "Scroll to bottom" button: resumes auto-scroll and snaps to bottom
- Stream completion: if user was auto-scrolling, keep at bottom; if manual, stay at position
- An asynchronously completed diagram height update follows the same rule:
  ResizeObserver keeps a pinned transcript at the bottom, while a user who has
  scrolled upward remains at their reading position.

### 2.4 Active turn surface

- An active turn keeps the lower transcript surface clear. Streamed assistant
  and tool rows remain inline with the transcript; no generic understanding,
  working, or checking card is rendered underneath them. A compact runtime
  status row is the only exception, and appears only when it explains a quiet
  interval that has no transcript row of its own: a provider wait or retry,
  context compaction, silent-turn recovery, the gap before the next request,
  or a delegated-work wait.
- A permission card remains visible only when the agent is blocked on an
  explicit approval. It is an actionable interruption, not a progress status
  card.
- Background sessions continue without adding progress chrome to the visible
  session or moving focus. Reduced motion therefore has no progress-card
  transitions to preserve.

### 2.5 Turn outcome closure

- A failed visible turn without a structured assistant error renders one
  session-scoped recovery card after the transcript content. It is based on the
  terminal agent event, not a timeout or a guessed spinner state. If the failed
  turn already contains a structured assistant error, that inline error card is
  the only failure surface and the session-scoped recovery card is omitted;
  users must not see duplicate failure summaries for one turn. Completed turns
  do not add a success card; their existing transcript and message-scoped
  review cards remain the completion evidence.
- Failure copy states that the existing work remains available. The applicable
  failure surface has exactly one **Continue** action and no **Regenerate**
  action. Continue appends the current locale's continuation prompt (`Continue
  the user's unfinished task.` / `继续用户未完成的任务`) to the same session and
  starts a new turn without truncating the failed turn or its completed work.
- Aborted turns do not render a failure card. Starting a new turn clears the
  previous card, and background-session results remain scoped until that
  session is selected.

### 2.3 Stream interruption

- If connection drops mid-stream: show error state on partial message
- Partial message is preserved — not deleted
- User sees "Stream interrupted" with retry option

## 3. Abort running agent

### 3.1 Trigger methods

- Topbar abort button (visible during running state)
- Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd/Ctrl + .`

### 3.2 Abort behavior

1. Cancel the current agent turn immediately
2. Cancel any pending permission request (per [03-permission-ux.md](03-permission-ux.md) §7)
3. If no assistant text, thinking, or tool row has begun, remove the just-sent
   user row and restore its pre-serialization composer draft
4. The restored draft keeps ordinary text and file-reference chips as separate
   state; serialized canonical paths never occupy the textarea
5. If a reply has begun, preserve the user turn and partial assistant/tool rows
   with aborted status and restore no draft. Preserve the measured stream
   duration and use provider output usage when available; otherwise store a
   visibly estimated output count so the conversation still shows throughput
6. Composer re-activates (unblocked)
7. Abort is idempotent — pressing abort when already aborting does nothing

### 3.3 Abort UX

- Abort button changes to "Aborting..." briefly (100ms), then disappears
- No confirmation dialog for abort — it is always immediate
- A partial aborted message gets a muted "(aborted)" suffix. Only the
  unanswered smart-stop branch deletes its just-sent user row.

### 3.4 Queued send

- While a session is running, the composer shows Send when the draft has
  content and Stop when it is empty. Normal Send and Enter-to-send are follow-up
  actions. Accepted follow-ups clear the composer and
  append to that session's Host-owned, persisted FIFO queue; session switching
  never moves or clears another session's queue.
- The queue renders above the composer. Each row has an independently
  keyboard-reachable Remove action and a Send now action.
- Send now moves its row to the head and requests the new `agent/stop` channel.
  The current assistant response and completed tool batch finish normally;
  after `agent_end` and durable turn finalization, the promoted row is
  dispatched through the normal `agent/prompt` flow before the remaining rows.
  An idle Send now dispatches immediately.
- Without Send now, the next FIFO row starts automatically after the active
  turn completes, fails, or is aborted. A terminal event can arrive before
  persistence releases the session; finalization must wake the queue again
  after releasing ownership. No additional send or session switch is required.
- Abort remains immediate and never clears the queue. Queued prompts survive
  application restart and remain held until a controller attaches (ADR 0213).
  Finalization during application shutdown must not start another queued turn.

### 3.5 Steer the current turn

- `Alt+Enter` submits the visible draft to the current turn immediately. On
  macOS this is `Option+Enter`. It works with Enter-to-send on or off and takes
  precedence over an open autocomplete menu. An idle composer sends normally.
- `Shift+Enter` and `Alt+Shift+Enter` insert a newline. An Enter confirming an
  IME candidate (`isComposing` or key code 229) never sends or steers.
- Steering appears as a user message in the current transcript, clears the
  draft immediately, and reaches the next model request after the current
  response/tool batch. It creates no FIFO row and does not interrupt tools.
- Submission captures the session and current turn identity. If that target
  ends, rejects input, or is awaiting approval, the draft is restored in its
  own session and a concise error is shown. New text typed after submission
  takes precedence over restoration. The running turn is not marked failed.
- File/image chips use the existing attachment checks and the active model's
  capability. Queued configuration changes apply to the next ordinary turn;
  steering keeps the current configuration and sends slash-prefixed text
  literally, without dispatching local mode or extension commands.
- Stop retains all accepted steering input as history. Smart Stop does not
  remove the latest steering row or restore the original prompt over it,
  including after renderer reload. The persisted message marker is the source
  of truth; the renderer does not keep a separate steering registry.
- The Send tooltip identifies follow-up and uses the platform's key labels
  for the steering shortcut (`⌥+Enter` on macOS). The
  existing single Send/Stop slot and Host-owned follow-up list are retained.

## 3A. Context checkpoint lifecycle

- `turn_end` marks one completed model/tool turn and may be followed by another
  provider request. It never re-enables the composer or session configuration.
- Automatic context protection evaluates after every `turn_end` and runs
  inline: the user waits for it. The model can also ask for it early through
  `new_context`, which lands at the same boundary.
- `compaction_start` keeps the session running. Threshold and overflow
  `compaction_end` events remain inside the active run; only `agent_end` or
  `error` settles it. A manual-only checkpoint settles on `compaction_end`.
- Every successful compaction shows one warning toast: earlier detail is gone,
  and starting a fresh session is a decision only the user can make. The three
  more specific toasts stay on top of it — a successful manual `/compact`
  result, a warning before an overflow retry, and the fallback warning below.
- If automatic summary generation fails but a retained-tail checkpoint is
  persisted, `compaction_end.fallback = "retained_tail"` shows one warning
  toast and the active run continues with reduced historical context.
- Manual failure shows one error toast. Automatic hard/overflow failure does
  not duplicate the assistant error with a toast; the terminal error remains
  attached to the failed turn.
- Compaction never removes visible transcript messages. The checkpoint affects
  only future model context and survives session switching/restart.
- Each compaction adds one divider row to the transcript, immediately after the
  last message it covers, reading how many times the session has compacted and
  the summary's estimated token cost (or that no summary was generated). The row
  has no actions and is not selectable.
- The context usage inspector keeps one muted line for the newest checkpoint,
  shown while its panel is open — the count and summary cost sit below the
  compact model/tool usage summaries without adding explanatory copy.

## 4. Long content collapse / expand

### 4.1 Collapse thresholds

| Content type | Default state | Collapse threshold | Expand limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Assistant markdown message | Expanded | 50 lines → collapsed to 20 lines visible | Full |
| Tool activity input | Row collapsed | Always behind disclosure | 220px scroll region |
| Tool activity output | Row collapsed | Always behind disclosure | 220px scroll region (per D033 host cap) |
| Bash output | Row collapsed | Always behind disclosure | 220px scroll region |
| Error messages | Expanded | No collapse | — |

### 4.2 Collapse indicator

- Tool activity starts as a lightweight collapsed row; failed calls open
  automatically so the error remains local to its invocation.
- Consecutive tool activity is wrapped in one processing group. Its header
  updates elapsed time once per second while active, freezes after the next
  transcript message, and exposes the number of contained steps. The latest
  action remains in the activity rows or dedicated runtime indicator; no
  additional status capsule is rendered.
- While the turn is active, the latest processing group opens automatically so
  its activity list is visible, but tool-call details remain collapsed by
  default. The latest thinking row opens automatically while it streams. When
  the activity settles, only automatic thinking disclosures close. A click or
  keyboard activation on a group, row, or collapse rail makes that disclosure
  user-owned; stream updates and completion never override it.
- A failed row is invocation-local truth and remains visible immediately. The
  containing group reports processing duration only and settles as processed,
  even when a later call recovers. Terminal turn failure is derived only from
  the terminal agent event and appears through either the assistant error or
  TurnOutcomeCard surface, plus sidebar state and notification surfaces.
- Expanding the processing group reveals the ordered rows; each row retains its
  own nested disclosure for output and input.
- Activating the row reveals clamped output first and raw input second.
- Each section scrolls internally and exposes its own copy action.
- The disclosure chevron rotates on expansion. Reduced-motion disables
  non-essential running-marker pulse and rotation animation.

### 4.3 Tool result truncation

- Per D306 / D194: budgets are per tool class (see [16-tool-result-limits](../03-runtime/16-tool-result-limits.md)). Search/read results cap at 128KB / 4000 lines; Bash stdout/stderr cap at 96KB / 4000 lines with a spill file.
- Read/Glob/Grep report `truncated: true` only when this result was cut short (budget, a clipped line, or remaining Grep/Glob hits). A filled Read window of a longer file is not truncated; `notice` names the next offset.
- Bash markers name which end survived and the spill path, for example `[truncated: kept the first 4000 of 51234 lines; limit 4000 lines / 96KB. …]`.
- Truncated content is never silently omitted — always marked
- Disclosure expansion does not load content beyond the host-enforced cap
- The collapsed-row `truncated` chip follows `details.truncated`

## 5. Permission interrupt flow

### 5.1 Flow sequence

```text
Agent calls a permission-gated tool (including Plan/Goal Bash under Ask or Accept edits)
  → PermissionCard inserted inline in transcript
  → Composer disabled (cannot send new prompt)
  → Countdown starts (120s)
  → User responds: Allow once / Allow session / Deny
  → Card transitions to resolved state
  → Composer re-enabled
  → Agent continues or receives denial result
```

### 5.2 Multiple pending permissions

- Each session has at most one active permission card because that agent loop
  is paused; multiple sessions may wait independently.
- Abort cancels only the active session's pending permission.
- Timeout (120s from original receipt) auto-denies only the matching request;
  switching sessions never resets the deadline.

### 5.3 Focus management during permission

- A visible permission card is announced through `aria-live` without forcing
  focus. A background session's card is not mounted and cannot move focus.
- Action buttons are tab-reachable within the card
- After resolution: focus returns to composer
- Full spec: [03-permission-ux.md](03-permission-ux.md)

## 5A. Plan and Goal workflow

1. The user selects Plan or Goal while the session is idle, or the same Agent
   calls `EnterPlanMode` / `EnterGoalMode`; the host persists/validates the
   matching contract mode and the renderer projects `planning`.
2. The Agent investigates with the selected contract tool set. Read/Glob/Grep and
   BrowserPreview are allowed; Bash follows the visible permission mode. A
   contract-mode Bash command may mutate under Auto, so the mode chip remains visible.
   While that turn is live `planning`, the Composer mode chip pulses and a compact
   Planning row occupies the same pre-stream slot as Working; tool or answer rows
   replace that transcript row so it does not sit orphaned above the composer.
3. The Agent calls `SubmitPlan` or `SubmitGoal` alone in its tool batch.
   Host-core preserves the exact Markdown bytes in a new immutable
   `.pi/plan/*.md` or `.pi/goal/*.md` artifact, records its path/hash/size and structured
   title/question, and the renderer displays the shared contract approval card with
   only the title and artifact opener; the question remains host-side contract data.
4. Approve requires Ask / Accept edits / Auto selection. The renderer remembers
   the last selected mode on this device and uses it as the next approval's
   default. Host-core commits the approval, `mode = agent`, permission mode,
   and `queued` state atomically; the same Agent continues on a fresh turn with
   Agent tools.
5. Reject stops the pending run and keeps the durable session in its contract
   mode. The live state returns to editable planning; revisions are new-turn
   `SubmitPlan`/`SubmitGoal` calls with a new complete Markdown snapshot and new artifact. Earlier snapshots
   remain immutable; there is no request-changes action.
6. Expiry, abort, persistence failure, renderer/host/sidecar crash, or stale
   response renders a failed-closed state. A host restart interrupts pending,
   queued, and running work without replay; an already-approved interruption
   keeps the session in Agent.

The approval card is session-scoped. Background sessions may retain a pending
approval or queued/running execution state in `plan_approvals`, but opening
another session never covers it or moves focus; returning to the originating
  session restores the renderer-lifetime snapshot; while the host remains alive,
  `plans.pending` can rehydrate a still-pending row. The approval card does not
  expose a validity/deadline concept.
Mode/provider/model/permission/shell configuration and new prompts remain
disabled while an active `pending` approval or turn exists. During pending
approval the existing draft remains in the textarea but is read-only; only
Approve and Reject remain enabled on the approval surface. Reject, expiry, or
interruption re-enables them; terminal proposal snapshots do not keep the gate
closed. The renderer retains the latest checkpoint/execution status per session
only for its current lifetime, so rejected, expired, interrupted, approved,
queued, and running outcomes may remain visible across session switches. A
renderer reload rehydrates only a pending row; terminal cards are dropped and
are not restored. Host restart interrupts prior work without replay or stale
action, and the UI is not required to present the interrupted terminal
snapshot. The Composer-left Agent/Plan/Goal chip is the only active-session mode
control.

During project or session initialization, the home composer can render before
an `activeSessionId` is projected. Idle mode, Thinking, and permission
controls remain usable in that interval; the durable empty session row is
created or selected by the New Task action and the first configuration action
applies to that session once it is projected. The startup-only home composer
may still materialize a session when pasted input arrives before selection.
Running turns and pending approvals continue to gate the controls.

## 6. Toast vs inline error

### 6.1 Toast notifications (use for)

| Scenario | Toast type | Duration | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Provider connection test result | Success/Error | 4s/8s | Transient feedback, not blocking workflow |
| Plugin load/unload success | Success | 4s | Confirmation of background action |
| Settings saved | Success | 4s | Quick confirmation |
| Manual menu update check failure | Error | 8s | Direct feedback for an explicit command |
| Context checkpoint completed | Info (Warning before overflow retry) | 4s/8s | Confirms a background context transition without altering transcript rows |
| Manual context checkpoint failure | Error | 8s | Direct feedback for explicit `/compact`; automatic terminal failures stay inline |

### 6.2 Inline errors (use for)

| Scenario | Inline placement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Tool call failure | Error state on ToolCallCard | Context-dependent, user needs to see which tool failed |
| Permission denial | Resolved state on PermissionCard | Already inline, part of conversation flow |
| Stream interruption | Error state on MessageBubble | Belongs to the message that failed |
| Provider/model turn failure | Assistant error message in transcript | Keeps summary, stable code, redacted detail, and recovery action attached to the failed turn |
| Provider configuration validation error | Inline in settings form | User needs to see which field is wrong |
| Application update status/error | Settings → Info Updates row | Preserves the latest Main-owned state without interrupting background checks |
| Composer validation (no model) | Disabled state + tooltip on send button | Immediate context |

### 6.3 Rules

- Never use toast for errors that are tied to a specific message or tool call
- Assistant error detail uses a keyboard-operable disclosure with
  `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls`; it is open on first render so the provider
  response is immediately discoverable, and supports copying the redacted text
- Never use inline error for transient background operations (plugin load, connection test)
- Toasts stack vertically, newest on top, at top-center
- Error toasts require manual dismiss or timeout at 8s (longer than success)
- Success toasts auto-dismiss at 4s

### 6.4 Icon-only action labels

- Every icon-only action exposes a localized purpose through both its accessible
  name and its hover/focus tooltip.
- Use the shared `TooltipButton` for interactive buttons and `Tooltip` for
  non-button controls. Both render the themed tooltip in a body-level portal so
  it is not clipped by pane overflow or hidden below a neighboring surface.
  Native `title` remains for full-value metadata such as paths, IDs, and
  descriptions; rich hover cards and popovers keep their specialized surfaces.
- Decorative icons remain `aria-hidden` and do not need a tooltip.
- Tooltip text must describe the action, not the icon shape, and must come from
  the active i18n catalog.
- Clicking an action dismisses its tooltip immediately and suppresses it until
  the pointer leaves or focus moves away; keyboard focus still reveals the
  tooltip before activation.

## 7. Focus management

### 7.1 Focus flow on page load

1. Composer textarea receives initial focus in main chat view
2. Settings pages: first interactive element receives focus
3. Command palette: search input receives focus on open

### 7.2 Focus flow after actions

| Action | Focus target |
|---|---|
| New session created | Composer textarea |
| Session switched | Composer textarea |
| Message sent | Composer textarea (cleared, ready for next) |
| Stream completed | Composer textarea (re-enabled) |
| Permission resolved | Composer textarea |
| Abort completed | Composer textarea |
| Command palette closed | Previously focused element |
| Dialog closed | Previously focused element |
| Notification popover closed with Escape | Notification bell |
| Notification row/native notification activated | Activated session composer after transcript load |

### 7.3 Focus trap

- Command palette: focus trapped within palette while open
- Settings modals: focus trapped
- Escape always closes the trapped surface and returns focus

### 7.4 Focus ring rules

- Only show focus ring on `focus-visible` (keyboard focus), not on click/mouse focus
- Focus ring: 2px accent color border, 2px offset from element edge
- Per [07-ui-design-system.md](07-ui-design-system.md) §6.4
- Never remove focus rings globally — accessibility requirement

### 7.5 Text selection

- Application chrome is non-selectable by default to prevent accidental
  selection while clicking or dragging the shell.
- Editable controls (`input`, `textarea`, `select`, and
  `[contenteditable]`) preserve normal text editing and `Cmd/Ctrl+A/C/V`
  behavior.
- Transcript prose, rendered Markdown, code blocks, and tool input/output
  remain text-selectable for inspection and copying.
- Interactive controls nested inside selectable content remain
  non-selectable and must keep their click and keyboard behavior.
- Selection rules must not disable `focus-visible` feedback or native window
  drag regions.

## 8. Drag / drop

### 8.1 MVP status

Work-panel and application-window resizing are implemented in MVP:

- The 10px inner left-edge separator anchors to the press position and
  starting panel width, then follows pointer delta without jumping. Moving it
  left grows the panel until the shared budget is exhausted; when MainChat
  reaches its 450px minimum the expanded sidebar collapses immediately. Moving
  it right gives space back to MainChat.
- The inner divider's target clamps to the shared three-column budget
  (`client width - 450px - expanded sidebar`, with no fixed pixel cap); pointer movement is
  frame-coalesced and release commits the preferred width. Escape, pointer
  cancellation, and lost capture restore the press-time panel width.
- Opening and closing animate the dock's `width` and `flex-basis` together with
  the bounded opacity/transform feedback, so MainChat reflows continuously
  inside the existing client area without crossing its 450px minimum instead of
  changing width before the first motion frame. While `sidebar-out` still
  occupies flex space, the shared budget continues to count the sidebar.
- Reopening a sidebar the layout collapsed spends work-panel width first: the
  panel keeps its width while MainChat stays at or above 450px, and otherwise
  the reopen targets 460px. Closing the panel restores only a sidebar the
  layout collapsed; a manual collapse stays collapsed.
- No panel action requests a positive native reservation: the preferred panel
  width is renderer-local, the native seam stays at zero, and native window
  edges resize only the fixed app window. Background-session artifacts never
  update the visible panel or window geometry.
- The native Browser view still follows the renderer-measured panel rectangle;
  it is detached before collapse motion because it cannot participate in
  renderer CSS animation. Native bounds recovery and persistence continue to
  apply to ordinary window resize/move gestures without panel-specific deltas.

- Preview mode unmounts MainChat and lets the work panel fill the client area
  beside the sidebar. A window-level 46px chrome row keeps New Task, sidebar,
  and native window controls available. In collapsed-sidebar macOS preview, the
  panel header reserves the 76px windowed (8px fullscreen) traffic-light inset,
  the preview action lane, and an 8px gap before its first tab.

The expanded sidebar is fixed at 275px. Collapse/open changes only whether the
column is present; the historical resize handle is hidden and legacy width
preferences are ignored.

Project ordering is implemented for retained project groups. There is no
reorder grip. Pressing the project title and moving 8px starts a project drag,
so a click still activates and toggles collapse, and menus and nested
session rows keep their existing click behavior. A drop inserts before or after
the target group based on the pointer position and persists the result.

Sidebar drag/drop is implemented:

- A session row is draggable while idle. Dropping it on another project group
  moves that session to the project: the host updates only the session's
  project association, and the transcript, attachments, tasks, revisions,
  artifacts, notifications, and scratch data stay with the session.
- A running session is not draggable, and the session menu's project targets
  are not available. The host rejects the move as well, so a turn that starts
  mid-drag cannot leave the agent bound to the previous project's instructions.
- The dragged row paints at opacity 0.5 and the eligible project group
  highlights with an accent outline. A session's own project group is not a
  drop target, so a same-project drag never issues a request.
- Project reassignment is available through the drag/drop interaction only;
  the session context menu does not contain a project list.
- Dropping a folder on the projects list adds it as a project, or switches to
  it when it is already known; duplicate paths resolve to one project row. A
  drop that carries no folder reports why nothing happened.

Native file-system drops into the composer are implemented. The target uses an
accent outline without changing layout; regular files use the session-scratch
reference flow below. A dropped folder is never attached: it raises an explicit
choice between opening it as a project and inserting the literal directory path
into the draft, so an unknown directory tree cannot enter the context.

### 8.2 Project drag/drop contract

Project drag/drop follows these patterns:

- The project title is the reorder control: press and move 8px to arm a drag
- A click with no qualifying movement still selects and toggles collapse
- Touch does not start a reorder so the list can scroll
- An accent insertion line shows before/after placement
- Cancel drag with Escape
- Drag feedback: opacity 0.5 on source
- ArrowUp/ArrowDown on the focused title moves the project one row and
  persists the same manual order without requiring a pointer

## 8a. Composer autocomplete and clipboard files (D123–D125, D197, D209, D262, D362, D397, ADR 0131, ADR 0222)

### 8a.1 Triggers

- `/` opens command mode only when it is the first character of the input
  and the cursor is still inside that first token (no whitespace typed yet).
  A space after the command name closes the menu; arguments are free text.
- `@` opens file mode when the token containing the cursor starts with `@`
  and the character before `@` is start-of-input, whitespace, or one of the
  pi delimiters (`"`, `'`, `=`). The query is the text between `@` and the
  cursor; a query containing `/` matches across path segments. A quoted
  token (`@"…`) is treated as one token until the closing quote.
- Pasting text never opens a menu unless the caret lands inside a valid
  trigger token.
- File results keep each row compact by rendering only the leaf name (with a
  trailing `/` for directories). The full relative path remains available as
  the row tooltip and accessible name. Accepting a file (Enter/Tab/click)
  replaces the `@` token with an inline sentinel-backed leaf-name chip at the
  caret, backed by the full `entry.path`; that confirmation does not send.
  Accepting a directory keeps the full literal path in the draft so deeper
  completion can continue.

### 8a.2 Reference chips and clipboard files

- Select non-whitespace `text/plain` over accompanying generated `image/*`
  copies only when every file lacks a native path (Word text selection).
  Native files, any non-image file, and image-only/whitespace-plus-image paste
  retain their attachment flow. This uses the existing preload file-path
  resolver and does not reread the system clipboard.
- Selected text stays editable when its character count is at or below the
  persisted `largePasteThreshold` (default 600); larger text becomes a temporary
  session file reference. Small multiline paste preserves blank/trailing lines,
  surrounding text, caret, and native undo; CRLF/CR becomes editor LF. Literal
  HTML remains text: only escaped text and generated line breaks are inserted.
- While bytes are being transferred, the textarea is read-only and exposes
  `aria-busy="true"`; the send and autocomplete controls are disabled.
- Electron main saves bounded bytes under the originating session's scratch
  root and returns unique absolute paths plus sanitized original leaf names.
  The composer leaves visible text unchanged, appends leaf-name reference
  chips in clipboard order, then restores the textarea selection and focus.
- For an oversized text-only paste, the renderer sends the exact UTF-8
  `text/plain` bytes through the same session bridge, inserts a
  sentinel-backed `pasted-text-*.txt` chip at the original selection, and keeps
  a token-to-canonical-path mapping in the draft. Clicking the chip or pressing
  Enter/Space reads the bounded text file and replaces the sentinel in place
  with editable text, removing the reference and placing the caret after the
  inserted content. A failed or unsupported read leaves the chip intact.
  Pasting in the middle of a draft keeps both the prefix and suffix intact.
- If the home composer has no active session, it creates or reuses one before
  writing. Failure leaves the existing draft unchanged and shows the error in
  the normal toast surface.
- A chip remove button removes only that draft reference and restores textarea
  focus; it does not eagerly delete session scratch bytes. Backspace on an
  empty textarea removes the most recent active reference.
- A text/plain or `.txt` chip exposes button semantics and expands on click or
  Enter/Space. The read is bounded by the existing `fsRead` policy; binary,
  image, oversized, or failed reads show the normal error toast and preserve
  the chip.
- A reference-only draft enables Send. Before dispatch, active references are
  appended after visible text and ordinary references are serialized with the
  canonical relative or absolute paths and existing whitespace quoting.
  Pasted references are submitted as structured attachments so the main
  process can choose visual input or the same path fallback from the exact
  model capability. Inline large-paste references are resolved in the visible
  draft instead of being appended or sent as duplicate attachments.
  Successful dispatch clears both; failed or rejected dispatch retains both.
  References are session-scoped and scratch references survive a workspace
  switch while their owning session remains available. Workspace `@` chips
  are relative to the project that produced them and are removed from the
  draft, sentinels included, when the workspace changes.
- When an image reference is active, Composer shows one compact live status
  line. It names visual transport for a model whose pi-ai `input` includes
  `image`, and names the file-path fallback for unknown/non-vision models.
  The status is informational, keyboard-safe, and never relies on color alone.
- A native file-system drop over the Composer prevents the browser's default
  file-open behavior and shows the same accent target outline for the whole
  shell. Regular files are read through the existing bounded paste bridge and
  become removable leaf-name chips in drop order. A dropped folder is not
  traversed or copied; its complete native path is inserted at the caret using
  the literal `@<path>/` directory form so the path remains visible; directory
  tokens without spaces can continue into `@` completion. Mixed file/folder
  drops preserve their order, and the draft/focus/caret are retained across the
  asynchronous file save.
- Accepted dispatch retains an in-memory, session/turn-scoped copy of the
  visible text and structured references only while unanswered smart Stop can
  undo the send. That undo restores the original chip order and labels; it
  never parses serialized `@path` text. Once reply content begins, abort keeps
  the partial transcript and restores no draft.
- After a successful send, the user bubble parses those serialized `@path`
  tokens back into composer-matching leaf-name chips for display only. The
  persisted message and model context stay canonical `@path` text. Clicking a
  workspace HTML chip previews it in the side browser; clicking any other
  allowed file opens it with the OS default application (`pi-desktop/fs/open`,
  contained to the workspace, session scratch, and attachments roots).

### 8a.3 Keyboard while open

- ↑/↓ move the highlight with wraparound; Home/End are left to the textarea.
- Enter / Tab accept the highlighted item; Alt+Enter uses active-turn steering
  instead of accepting a suggestion. Enter and Cmd/Ctrl+Enter never send
  while the menu has a highlighted item (this precedes the Enter-to-send setting).
  otherwise keeps its behavior).
- Escape closes only the menu — it takes precedence over the composer's
  "clear input or blur" Escape and must not propagate to overlay handlers.
- Any other typing re-filters in place; zero matches behaves as closed.

### 8a.4 IME (first normative IME rules)

- All autocomplete key handling sits behind the standard guard
  (`isComposing || keyCode === 229`).
- During active composition the trigger detector neither opens, updates,
  nor closes the menu; state re-evaluates on `compositionend`.
- Enter that confirms an IME candidate never sends and never accepts a menu
  item; ↑/↓ during candidate navigation belong to the IME.

### 8a.5 Close and focus rules

- Close on: outside mousedown, textarea blur, deleting past the trigger
  character, session or workspace switch, accepting an item (except `@dir/`
  continuation, which keeps the menu open on the deeper query).
- Focus stays in the textarea for the menu's whole lifecycle (input-retained
  overlay); the menu is never a focus trap and never steals the caret.

## 9. Scroll behavior

### 9.1 Transcript scrolling

- Default: auto-scroll to bottom on new content during stream while pinned
- The first upward scroll **gesture** (wheel / trackpad / touch / scrollbar /
  keyboard) pauses auto-scroll and shows the "↓ Scroll to bottom" button;
  queued stream or resize follow work must not reverse that movement
- Programmatic follow scrolling and layout-driven clamps never release follow:
  a scroll event with no preceding user input (for example a scrollTop clamp
  when the composer collapses after send or an indicator row unmounts) is
  treated as layout noise and re-baselined instead of being mistaken for a
  user scrolling up
- A pinned transcript re-pins in the same frame the content or the viewport
  changes size, never one frame later. That includes the composer growing under
  a multi-line draft: the bottom reserve is padding on the transcript content, so
  the content is observed on its border box and the newest turn moves up with
  the composer instead of sliding behind it (D287).
- User send / retry / regenerate: re-pins, hides the jump control, and positions the latest content in the layout phase so the new turn is visible without a top-of-history flash; subsequent persisted and streamed rows continue to follow the bottom
- Scroll-to-bottom button: position fixed at bottom-right of transcript area, offset 12px
- Button appears as soon as upward scrolling releases follow mode
- Click button: scrolls to bottom, resumes auto-scroll
- Button disappears when at bottom
- The subagent task dock uses the same single-body scroll owner as the work
  panel. It renders the task description followed by the delegate's live
  thinking, tool, and answer rows in normal content flow; it does not mount a
  nested `.subagent-run-rows` workflow scrollbar. While the panel is pinned,
  new process rows stay in view; a real upward gesture pauses follow and shows
  the standard jump-to-latest control. This keeps the process readable without
  a second scrollbar or an empty tail.
- Clicking a delegation topology node toggles an inset grouped side sheet in the
  right-side work-panel dock instead of expanding the transcript. Clicking the
  selected node again closes the side sheet; selecting another node replaces
  the current detail in place. The dock has
  a sticky identity header (avatar, name, and model caption on the left; status
  capsule and elapsed time trailing on the same row), the Task call's selectable description as a full-width grouped
  card under a Task section label, capped at four lines with an inline Show
  more / Show less control for longer tasks, and its live process under an
  Activity section on one subtle vertical timeline; it does not render separate
  details, output, or workflow tabs. At the minimum panel width, long commands,
  paths, and tool summaries remain contained by the dock instead of expanding
  the side sheet past the client area.
  Selecting another node replaces the task in place, closing it restores the
  prior resource view when present, and switching sessions or routes hides the
  selection. `Cmd/Ctrl + J` hides the whole dock.

### 9.1a Sidebar project path and open folder

- Hovering or focusing a retained project title shows the full absolute path.
- The truncated project name remains visible in the row; the full path is
  tooltip/accessible-description only and never forces horizontal scroll.
- Right-clicking a project row or opening its overflow menu exposes **Open
  folder** as a project action, along with the project management actions. It
  does not expose project activation; click the directory row to activate it.
  Conversation overflow no longer carries the folder action.
- Choosing **Open folder** opens the project directory in the system file
  manager without changing the active session transcript.

### 9.1b Sidebar session hover card

- Hovering or focusing a session row reveals a multi-line hover card after
  the same 500ms delay used by the project path tooltip; the card never
  anchors to a torn-down row.
- The card surfaces the row's metadata in this order, top to bottom: title,
  tag chips, **Workspace**, branch (when the project exposes one), and
  **Updated {{when}}**. Temporary/scratch sessions show the localized
  "Temporary" / "临时对话" placeholder instead of a workspace name.
- For a session with host-owned collaboration activity, the card adds a
  bounded collaboration section after the standard metadata: localized
  status, creator/source session when present, current task preview, and up to
  four recent exchanges with direction, kind, and terminal result. It may
  show a live `running` or `waiting_permission` state, but never loads the
  complete transcript or exposes message content beyond the host's bounded
  preview. Completion and failure results are derived from the durable target
  turn and remain visible after reload.
- Before showing a project session card, the renderer re-reads the active
  workspace through the existing project-read operation. This keeps the Git
  branch current after an external checkout without activating a project or
  changing the selected conversation. If the read fails, the last cached
  branch is used.
- The card is rendered through a portal at `document.body`, never widens
  beyond 320px, never causes horizontal scroll on the underlying row, and
  stays non-interactive so the row keeps receiving pointer events.
- The session row does not set a native `title` attribute. The hover card is
  the only full-title surface, so the browser tooltip never stacks on the
  card.
- The card cancels on pointer leave, focus blur, scroll (any scroll
  container), resize, and the moment a context menu opens.

### 9.2 Sidebar scrolling

- The standalone Sessions body is capped at five compact rows and scrolls
  internally when additional sessions exist.
- Retained project groups occupy the remaining sidebar height and scroll in a
  separate region. Both regions stay independent from the footer and primary
  navigation.
- No horizontal scroll in sidebar
- Scroll indicators use the platform's subtle overlay treatment without
  changing either region's width. The 6px thumb is transparent at rest and
  appears when the owning list is hovered or focused; dragging keeps it
  visible until the interaction ends.

### 9.3 Settings scrolling

- Settings content scrolls independently within main area
- Left nav (settings sections) is sticky, does not scroll

## 10. Reduced motion

### 10.1 Policy

All animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`:

1. **Suppress:** streaming pulse, expand/collapse transitions, dropdown slide, hover color transitions
2. **Keep (instant):** state changes still occur (card status changes, loading → complete) but with no transition duration
3. **Never remove:** focus rings, status colors, layout positioning — these are structural, not decorative

### 10.2 Implementation

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

This does not prevent state changes — it makes them instant.

### 10.3 Affected patterns from this doc

| Pattern | Normal | Reduced motion |
|---|---|---|
| Streaming pulse | accent pulse on left border | static accent border (no pulse) |
| Tool card expand/collapse | 200ms transition | instant toggle |
| Hover state transition | 150ms background change | instant color change |
| Startup splash | Brand splash + progress, min dwell then fade out | Instant static splash, no bar motion, instant reveal |
| Dialog / search enter | overlay-in + surface-in via motion tokens | Near-zero duration enter |
| Scroll-to-bottom button fade-in | 150ms opacity | instant appear |
| Toast slide-in | 200ms slide | instant appear |
| Modal/dialog enter | 300ms fade+scale | instant appear |
| Notification popover enter | menu-scale/fade token | instant appear |

### 10.4 Programmatic scrolling

- Session activation uses an immediate layout-phase bottom position so the
  first visible frame is already stable at the latest record.
- Jump-to-latest and minimap navigation use smooth scrolling only when the OS
  has not requested reduced motion.
- Turn-start following uses an immediate layout-phase update and then a
  frame-coalesced instant follow; it does not start overlapping smooth-scroll
  animations for token groups.
- Manual upward movement cancels a queued pinned-follow frame before it can
  restore the previous bottom position. Follow remains released across content
  growth until the viewport is scrolled down within 48px of the bottom or an
  explicit turn-start / jump-to-latest action re-pins it.
- Released-follow detection is gated on a recent user scroll input. Native
  scroll events from a follow `scrollTo` whose position was later clamped by
  layout changes (composer height, indicator rows) arrive after the fact and
  look like an upward gesture; because they have no preceding input they are
  ignored and follow mode is preserved.
- Resize observers never synchronously measure every transcript row from their
  callback. The one synchronous action they may take is the bottom re-pin of a
  pinned, visible transcript (a single `scrollTo`), because a frame requested
  from inside the callback lands after the current frame has already painted
  the grown content unpinned (D287).

## 11. Acceptance criteria

1. All keyboard shortcuts in §1 are functional and do not conflict with system shortcuts
2. Enter sends when Enter-to-send is on; when it is off, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter sends and Enter/Shift+Enter insert a newline
3. Abort immediately cancels running turn and pending permissions without confirmation dialog
3a. Send stays enabled while running, queues prompts per session, and Send now
    finishes the current boundary before releasing its prioritized prompt
4. Long content (>50 lines for messages, >10 for args, >20 for results) is collapsed by default with expand link
5. Tool results that were cut short show a truncation marker or chip per D306; a filled Read window of a longer file does not
6. Permission interrupt inserts inline card, disables composer, shows countdown, and re-enables after resolution
7. Toasts used for transient background operations; inline errors used for context-specific failures
8. Focus returns to composer after session switch, message send, permission resolution, and abort
9. Background message, tool, completion, and permission events never change
   the active session/project/page or keyboard focus; concurrent permission
   requests remain independently actionable in their originating transcripts,
   and background artifacts update only their session's retained work-panel
   context
9a. Creating a new session or switching to a non-running session returns the
    composer to its idle Send state even while another session is still
    streaming; the destination session's own run state alone decides the
    send/abort button. New Task reveals the empty destination on the first
    frame rather than leaving the previous transcript visible until host IO
    completes.
10. Focus rings visible on `focus-visible` only, 2px accent offset 2px
11. Command palette traps focus; Escape returns to previous focus
12. All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — state changes are instant, no decorative motion
13. Project/session rows support non-destructive pin/archive, independent
    project collapse, project drag/manual reorder, and the documented
    user-facing sort modes
14. Shell chrome does not create accidental text selections, while editable
    controls and transcript/code/tool content remain selectable and copyable
15. Retained project tabs survive restart; activating one changes the selected
    shell workspace without redirecting background session tool roots
16. Project groups can be reordered by dragging the title or with
    ArrowUp/ArrowDown on that title; the normalized-path order survives a
    renderer restart and does not change the host workspace identity
17. Completed and failed turns appear exactly once in the durable inbox;
    aborted turns never appear
18. All/Unread, mark-all-read, clear, row activation, Escape/focus restore, and
    arrow/Home/End keyboard navigation behave as documented in §1.7
19. Native task notifications appear only while the main window is unfocused;
    interactive prompt notifications may alert for a focused background session.
    Activation focuses the window and opens the corresponding session
20. Streamed message updates stay within the chat render boundary; shell
    navigation, composer, completed rows, and work-panel content do not rerender
    solely because the current assistant message appended content
21. The work panel opens and collapses inside the fixed client area; the inner
    divider follows the shared budget while MainChat keeps its 450px minimum,
    the expanded sidebar yields at the threshold and returns when the panel
    closes, and divider cancellation restores the prior panel width
