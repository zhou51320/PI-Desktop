## 1. Build lanes

| Lane | Command | Signing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dev | `pnpm dev` | none | daily development |
| Local package | `pnpm --filter @pi-desktop/desktop pack` | unsigned without a configured certificate | packaging smoke (`--dir` output) |
| Local DMG | `pnpm --filter @pi-desktop/desktop dist` | unsigned without a configured certificate | local install test |
| Release | `scripts/release-macos.sh` | Developer ID + mandatory notarization | distributable artifact |

The static electron-builder config does not embed a certificate identity, so
contributors without certificates can still package locally. The release lane
requires an injected Developer ID identity (local) or `CSC_LINK` certificate
(CI), and fails before publication if signing or notarization verification does
not pass.

On macOS, `pnpm dev` creates and reuses a fingerprinted branded Electron host
bundle under `.cache/electron-dev/`. Its bundle name, executable, identifier,
and ICNS resource are development-only PI-Desktop values, so AppKit shows
PI-Desktop in the application menu and uses the canonical icon in the native
About panel. The runtime also applies `build/icon_1024.png` to the Dock. Stock
files under `node_modules` are never modified. Windows/Linux development keeps
the normal electron-vite executable. Windows Main nevertheless registers the
same `com.pi-desktop.app` AppUserModelID used by the NSIS package before
Electron readiness, preventing the stock host identity from owning native
notifications or taskbar groups. The Windows package additionally pins the
`PI-Desktop` executable and Start menu shortcut names. The launcher sets
`PI_DESKTOP_DEV=1` so runtime packaging checks keep update delivery disabled
and preserve developer workspace defaults despite the branded executable name.
The first `pnpm dev` on Electron 43+ downloads the Electron binary on demand
(the package no longer installs it during `pnpm install`).
Packaged lanes use `build/icon.icns` through electron-builder on macOS and
`build/icon.ico` for the Windows executable and native window icon. The
renderer imports the same PNG through `BrandLogo`. The PNG is canonical;
`scripts/make-icon.py` derives the multi-size Windows ICO, the 512px
Windows/Linux package PNG, the
transparent monochrome `build/tray-icon-mac.png` template, and the iconset/ICNS
when macOS `iconutil` is available, without overwriting the canonical source.

## 2. Prerequisites (release lane)

1. Apple Developer account with a **Developer ID Application** certificate in
   the login keychain.
2. Environment variables:
   - `MAC_SIGNING_IDENTITY` — e.g. `Developer ID Application: <Name> (<TEAMID>)`
   - `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` — required for
     notarization.
3. Rust toolchain and pnpm workspace installed. The Rust toolchain must run on
   the native macOS runner: arm64 for Apple Silicon or x86_64 for Intel.

## 3. What the build ships

- Electron app with hardened runtime + entitlements
  (`build/entitlements.mac.plist`: JIT + unsigned-executable-memory +
  library-validation disable — the standard Electron set).
- `Resources/bin/pi-desktop-host-core` — Rust host binary (release build).
- Windows NSIS builds include an x64 `pi-desktop-host-core.exe` statically
  linked to the MSVC CRT, so a clean Windows x64 or Windows 11 ARM64
  (x64-emulated) installation does not need a separate Visual C++
  Redistributable before the local service can start.
- `Resources/agent-runtime/` — bundled sidecar, executed with
  `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` (no separate Node shipped).
- `Resources/licenses/` — notices that must remain distributable when the
  corresponding dependency's build-only source tree is pruned.
- `Resources/app.asar` — Electron Main, preload, renderer output, and only the
  runtime-resolved production modules. Renderer libraries are already present
  in Vite output and are not copied again as raw package trees.
- Chromium locale packs for English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
  Turkish, German, Spanish, French, and Korean. Product catalogs remain bundled
  independently of Chromium locales.
- App icons `build/icon.icns` and `build/icon.ico` (derived from canonical
  `build/icon_1024.png` by `scripts/make-icon.py`).
- macOS menu bar template `build/tray-icon-mac.png`, derived from the dark PI
  mark with a transparent background; Windows/Linux use the product PNG tray
  resource.

## 4. Release steps

### 4.1 Mandatory release version-surface gate (D164 + D260)

**Every product release that bumps a stable app version and cuts a tag MUST
first update every version-bearing surface: the shipped-locale in-app product
changelog and the version numbers stated in project documentation.** Tagging a
stable version while any surface still describes an older version is a
**release process failure**: packaged builds cannot show "what's new" without a
network fetch, the READMEs advertise a stale release line, and GitHub
auto-generated release bodies are **not** a substitute (extends D120 /
ADR 0022).

Surfaces in scope:

| Surface | Requirement |
|---|---|
| `apps/desktop/resources/models.dev/api.json` | Refreshed from https://models.dev/api.json before tagging; the release workflow packages this snapshot unchanged |
| `packages/shared/src/changelog.ts` | Newest-first English, zh-CN, and zh-TW entries, matching highlight counts |
| `packages/shared/src/changelog-de.ts`, `changelog-es.ts`, `changelog-fr.ts`, `changelog-ko.ts`, `changelog-tr.ts` | Same versions and highlight counts as English |
| `packages/shared/src/changelog.test.ts` | Version added at the top of the newest-first list |
| `package.json`, `apps/*/package.json`, `packages/*/package.json`, `docs/package.json` | Same version (`docs` is a third workspace root, not under `apps`/`packages`) |
| `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.package]`, `Cargo.lock` `host-core` | Same version |
| `packages/shared/src/protocol.ts` `APP_VERSION` | Same version |
| `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md` | Status section states the current `<major>.<minor>.x` release line; toolchain, command, and roadmap claims still true |

Blocking steps:

1. Refresh `apps/desktop/resources/models.dev/api.json` **before** tagging.
   `scripts/release.mjs` does this by default for every bump, including
   prereleases. A no-op refresh (already current) still counts: the snapshot
   in the tagged tree is what artifacts ship. Do not treat a minified
   one-line JSON diff as absent.
2. Edit `packages/shared/src/changelog.ts` **before**
   `node scripts/release.mjs <version>` / `git tag`:
   - Add a **newest-first** entry under `en` and every shipped product locale
     (`zh-CN` / `zh-TW` in this file; `de` / `es` / `fr` / `ko` / `tr` in
     `packages/shared/src/changelog-*.ts`).
   - Same `version` string (semver **without** a leading `v`, matching
     `apps/desktop` / `APP_VERSION` for a stable cut).
   - Optional ISO `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
   - Matching highlight counts; English is the source of truth (ADR 0009).
   - Each bullet is one short user-facing idea (not raw PR titles).
3. Do **not** catalog the prerelease identifier (`x.y.z-rc.*`,
   `x.y.z-beta.*`) as its own in-app changelog version. When the prerelease
   is a preview of the next stable line, add that **stable** version's
   entries (`x.y.z`) so testers can read "what's new" without a network
   fetch. Omit the catalog only when product explicitly ships no notes for
   this cut.
4. Sync the newest-first version list in
   `packages/shared/src/changelog.test.ts` (add the new stable version at the
   top), then run `pnpm --filter @pi-desktop/shared test` and confirm catalog
   alignment (version sets + highlight counts) still passes.
5. Update `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` when the release line changes
   (`0.10.x` → `0.11.x`) and whenever the release ships user-visible behavior
   the Highlights, Download, Getting started, Status, or Development sections
   now describe incorrectly. Both locales stay structurally in sync; English is
   the source of truth and the zh-CN file links the `docs/zh-CN/` mirrors.
6. Run the preflight and fix every reported surface:
   `pnpm check:release-docs [version]` (`node scripts/check-release-docs.mjs`).
   For a prerelease, run it against the **stable** version being previewed
   (`pnpm check:release-docs x.y.z`) so changelog/README alignment is
   checked even though `scripts/release.mjs` skips that preflight for
   `x.y.z-beta.*` / `x.y.z-rc.*`. The preflight compiles the TypeScript
   changelog in a temporary directory, so it does not require a prior
   workspace build. `scripts/release.mjs` still refreshes models.dev for
   prereleases; `--skip-docs-check` exists only for a deliberate
   non-release bump.
7. Commit the documentation updates so the tagged commit contains notes and
   accurate version claims for that version (alone or adjacent to the bump).
8. GitHub Release bodies may still use `generate_release_notes: true` for the
   web page; they remain web-only and are **not** the in-app notes source.

Pre-tag checklist:

- [ ] `apps/desktop/resources/models.dev/api.json` is refreshed or confirmed
      current in the tagged tree
- [ ] `packages/shared/src/changelog.ts` has English / zh-CN / zh-TW entries
      for the stable version being shipped or previewed
- [ ] `packages/shared/src/changelog-de.ts` and the other locale catalogs
      match the English version set and highlight counts
- [ ] Highlight counts match across locales
- [ ] Shared changelog tests pass
- [ ] `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` state the current release line and
      contain no claims the release invalidates
- [ ] `node scripts/check-release-docs.mjs` passes on the release commit
      (use the stable version when tagging a prerelease preview)
- [ ] `release.mjs` / tag runs only after the documentation commit is on the
      release branch

### 4.2 Build / package

```bash
export MAC_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: ... (TEAMID)"
export APPLE_ID=...
export APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=...
export APPLE_TEAM_ID=...
scripts/release-macos.sh
```

Artifacts land in `apps/desktop/release/` (DMG + ZIP + blockmaps).

`scripts/release-macos.sh` defaults to the host architecture and accepts
`MAC_ARCH=arm64` or `MAC_ARCH=x64` only when that architecture matches the
host. This keeps the native Rust host sidecar and Electron package aligned.

### 4.3 GitHub tag and manual workflow

The GitHub Release workflow starts all native platform runners without a
separate validation-job barrier. Each runner validates that the pushed tag
matches `apps/desktop/package.json` immediately after checkout, before package
inputs are prepared.

On every platform, the release preparation step starts the locked Rust host
build in parallel with pnpm installation and native dependency rebuilding. It
then builds only the workspace dependencies selected by
`@pi-desktop/desktop^...`, failing if that dependency selection is unexpectedly
empty. The platform `dist:*` command remains responsible for bundling the agent
runtime, verifying the host build, building the Desktop application once, and
invoking electron-builder. This avoids a redundant Desktop build without
changing the package scripts or release artifacts.

**Default macOS release policy:** the GitHub Release workflow packages macOS
DMG/ZIP artifacts unsigned by default. Tag pushes and manual runs with
`sign_macos` omitted or set to `false` disable identity discovery, do not receive
signing or notarization secrets, and skip macOS stapling and signature
verification. To explicitly sign a run, manually dispatch the workflow for the
target tag with `sign_macos: true`. The local `scripts/release-macos.sh` command
remains the explicit signed lane.

The macOS matrix uses `macos-15` for arm64 and `macos-15-intel` for Intel x64.
Each job verifies `uname -m`, passes the matching `--arm64` or `--x64` flag to
electron-builder, and builds `pi-desktop-host-core` on that same native
runner. The default macOS package step is unsigned. When a manual run explicitly
sets `sign_macos: true`, it receives `CSC_LINK`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`,
`APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` only from GitHub Actions
secrets. It then forces code signing and notarization, verifies the Developer ID
authority, code-signing integrity, Gatekeeper assessment, and stapled app
ticket, and explicitly staples and validates the generated DMG before any
artifact upload. The per-architecture
`latest-mac.yml` files are renamed before upload; the publish job merges them
into one feed after downloading both artifacts.

The shared electron-builder configuration applies the architecture-labelled
pattern at the macOS platform level for ZIPs and overrides it at the DMG target
level. Both public architectures are therefore explicit: the arm64 lane
publishes `PI-Desktop-<version>-arm64.dmg` and
`PI-Desktop-<version>-arm64-mac.zip`, while the Intel x64 lane publishes
`PI-Desktop-<version>-x64.dmg` and `PI-Desktop-<version>-x64-mac.zip`. This
applies to both unsigned and signed macOS lanes, including local release builds,
and ensures each generated updater feed references its architecture-labelled
asset names and matching checksums. Before upload, each macOS runner requires
exactly one architecture-labelled DMG and ZIP (including blockmaps) and rejects
any unlabelled or wrong-architecture macOS artifact.

The DMG uses a branded 720×500 background with a clear drag-to-Applications
gesture. The app and Applications link occupy the main row; the first-launch
opening note sits in a secondary row so the unsigned-build path is discoverable
without making it the normal installation action. The note is displayed as
`If app won't open, read this.txt`; the DMG does not include the executable command helper.

Every macOS DMG includes the companion
`PI-Desktop-macOS-opening-help.txt` at the package root under that display
name. The macOS ZIP includes both that note and the executable
`PI-Desktop-macOS-open.command`. After moving `PI-Desktop.app` to
`/Applications` or `~/Applications`, ZIP users can double-click the helper. It
searches only those two fixed locations, removes only the recursive
`com.apple.quarantine` attribute when present, and opens PI-Desktop. Before
doing so it verifies `CFBundleIdentifier=com.pi-desktop.app`. It does not use
`sudo` or accept an arbitrary application path. The manual fallback for the
standard system location is:

```sh
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PI-Desktop.app
```

This helper is only for a trusted unsigned artifact when macOS reports that the
app is damaged. Signed and notarized builds should open without it.

DMG, ZIP, NSIS, AppImage, deb, rpm, blockmap, and updater feed outputs are already
compressed or compression-insensitive. The workflow therefore uploads their
temporary Actions artifacts with compression level zero before the publish job
assembles the GitHub Release. The Linux runner also copies
`linux-unpacked/resources/app.asar` to the versioned
`PI-Desktop-<version>-linux-x64.asar` asset before upload. This preserves the
exact archive used by the Linux installers for downstream repackaging with a
system Electron.

### 4.4 CNB mirror trigger

After `softprops/action-gh-release` publishes or updates a GitHub Release,
`.github/workflows/mirror-to-cnb.yml` starts the CNB pipeline at
`aixk/Pi-Desktop`. GitHub Release remains the canonical artifact source; CNB
is a copy of the same tag for users who pull from
https://cnb.cool/aixk/Pi-Desktop.

The job:

- runs only on `vastsa/PI-Desktop`
- fires on `release` `published` / `edited`, and on `workflow_dispatch` with
  an explicit tag such as `v0.14.6`
- sends event `api_trigger_mirror` and `MIRROR_TAGS` set to that tag
- uses repository secret `CNB_MIRROR_TOKEN` (already configured) and fails
  closed if the secret is empty
- builds the JSON body with `jq` so a missing tag cannot produce an empty
  `MIRROR_TAGS` value on a manual run

Re-running the workflow for the same tag is safe if the CNB pipeline is
idempotent. It does not rebuild desktop artifacts and does not change
electron-updater feeds.

## 5. Verification gates

For the default unsigned macOS lane, do not treat macOS artifacts as
Gatekeeper-qualified. The signature and staple checks below apply only when a
run explicitly enables `sign_macos: true`.

Run after every release build:

```bash
for APP in apps/desktop/release/mac-*/PI-Desktop.app; do
  codesign -dv --verbose=2 "$APP"          # identity + hardened runtime flags
  codesign --verify --deep --strict "$APP" # signature integrity
  spctl -a -vv "$APP"                      # Gatekeeper assessment (notarized Developer ID)
  xcrun stapler validate "$APP"             # notarization staple
done
xcrun stapler validate apps/desktop/release/*.dmg
```

### 5.1 Package footprint gate

Inspect every native-runner package before publication and record all
compressed artifact formats, unpacked application, ASAR, Electron
framework/runtime, locale, and unpacked-native sizes. Compare them with the
previous stable release; an unexplained increase above 15% blocks publication
until reviewed.

The package inventory must confirm:

- exactly one `Resources/agent-runtime/sidecar.js` and one target-native Rust
  host binary
- no raw renderer packages such as Mermaid, Shiki, React, KaTeX, or Lucide
  under packaged `node_modules`
- no dependency `*.map`, test, example, declaration, or second agent-runtime
  tree in ASAR
- required third-party license and notice files remain in ASAR or
  `Resources/licenses` when their non-runtime package trees are pruned
- only the configured English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
  Turkish, German, Spanish, French, and Korean Chromium locale packs

The first audited optimized package establishes the platform baseline. Keep
per-platform measurements rather than applying one budget to different
Electron target layouts.

The first macOS arm64 baseline was captured on 2026-07-30 from an unsigned
`electron-builder --dir` package. Sizes below sum regular-file bytes so they
remain comparable across filesystems; the compressed artifact is not
applicable to this directory-only validation build.

| Inventory | Bytes | MiB |
|---|---:|---:|
| Unpacked application | 251,724,810 | 240.1 |
| `Contents/Frameworks` | 218,567,792 | 208.4 |
| `Contents/Resources` | 33,102,807 | 31.6 |
| `Resources/app.asar` | 20,944,962 | 20.0 |
| `Resources/app.asar.unpacked` native payload | 137,336 | 0.1 |
| Historical English and Simplified Chinese Chromium locale packs baseline | 1,033,673 | 1.0 |
| Agent sidecar | 3,258,983 | 3.1 |
| Rust host | 7,160,000 | 6.8 |

The pre-optimization unpacked regular-file total was 559,355,716 bytes
(533.4 MiB). The audited package is 307,630,906 bytes smaller, a 55.0%
reduction. Its curated renderer output is 14.1 MiB, down from 20.5 MiB.

#### Renderer output budget

The renderer bundle carries three standing controls. Regressing any of them
shows up as renderer growth in the table above and must be explained before
publication:

- **Minification is explicit.** `electron-vite` hard-defaults the renderer
  preset to `minify: false`, unlike plain Vite, so
  `apps/desktop/electron.vite.config.ts` sets `minify: "esbuild"`. Removing it
  silently doubles emitted JS.
- **Legacy font formats are stripped.** The `pi-drop-legacy-font-fallbacks`
  plugin removes `woff` and `truetype` `src` entries before Vite registers
  them as assets. The bundled Chromium supports `woff2` universally, so those
  faces would be emitted and never served.
- **Brand marks are renderer-sized.** `src/assets/brand/logo-{light,dark}.png`
  are the renderer assets. `build/icon_1024.png` and `build/logo_dark.png` are
  electron-builder installer icons and must not be imported by the renderer.

Renderer output measured on 2026-08-26 after applying these three controls,
against the same tree at `v0.10.8`:

| Renderer group | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| JavaScript (120 chunks) | 12.53 MiB | 7.72 MiB |
| `woff2` | 15.71 MiB | 15.71 MiB |
| `woff` + `ttf` legacy fallbacks (40 files) | 0.78 MiB | 0 |
| PNG brand assets | 1.23 MiB | 0.27 MiB |
| CSS | 0.42 MiB | 0.35 MiB |
| **Total `out/renderer`** | **31 MiB** | **24 MiB** |

The two bundled CJK faces (`lxgw-wenkai.woff2` 7.6 MiB, `noto-sans-sc.woff2`
7.4 MiB) dominate the remainder. They stay unsubset on purpose: ADR 0083 §2
appends `Noto Sans SC` to every font stack so Chinese text stays readable
offline, and subsetting would drop glyphs from user-supplied content. Reducing
them requires an ADR revision, not a build-config change.

Manual smoke on a clean profile (`PI_DESKTOP_DATA_DIR=$(mktemp -d)`):

1. `pnpm dev` launches with `PI-Desktop` in the macOS application menu and the
   canonical icon in both the Dock and native About panel; no Electron brand is
   visible.
2. App launches from DMG install, window appears, and the application-menu,
   About-panel, and Dock branding match the development lane.
3. Empty home and expanded/collapsed sidebar show the canonical PI-Desktop
   logo; composer prompt rows have no leading brand icon; New task and
   project/Temporary create controls use the message-plus session icon.
4. Onboarding checklist appears; configure provider; one streamed chat turn.
5. One permissioned tool call (Write) allow + deny paths.
6. Quit/relaunch → session history restored, window bounds restored.
7. `~/.pi-desktop/logs/` contains categorized NDJSON under `app/`, `host/`,
   and `agent/`; key lifecycle, tool, provider, plugin, and error records are
   available without dedicated timing files.
8. With network access disabled, the shell still starts; English/Chinese
   switching, syntax highlighting, shell highlighting, KaTeX, Mermaid
   fallback/rendering, host health, and sidecar health continue to use packaged
   local assets.

## 6. Native-runner release packages

The repository exposes native-runner commands for every release target. Each
packaging command first runs `build:host-release`, then bundles the agent
runtime and Electron app. D126/D285 tag workflows publish these outputs and
their electron-updater manifests. Run a target command on that target OS:

```text
macOS Apple Silicon: pnpm --filter @pi-desktop/desktop run dist:mac -- --arm64
macOS Intel:         pnpm --filter @pi-desktop/desktop run dist:mac -- --x64
Windows: pnpm --filter @pi-desktop/desktop dist:win
Linux:   pnpm --filter @pi-desktop/desktop dist:linux
```

The macOS packages include `bin/pi-desktop-host-core` built for their runner
architecture; Windows includes `bin/pi-desktop-host-core.exe`; Linux includes
`bin/pi-desktop-host-core`. Signing, rollback, and installer upgrade
qualification remain release hardening work; publication is active under
D126/D285.

Native-runner output matrix:

- macOS arm64: `PI-Desktop-<version>-arm64.dmg` and
  `PI-Desktop-<version>-arm64-mac.zip`
- macOS Intel x64: `PI-Desktop-<version>-x64.dmg` and
  `PI-Desktop-<version>-x64-mac.zip`
- Windows x64: NSIS installer `PI-Desktop-Setup-<version>.exe` and portable
  exe `PI-Desktop-Portable-<version>.exe`
- Linux x64: AppImage, deb, and rpm
- Linux x64 system Electron asset: `PI-Desktop-<version>-linux-x64.asar`

The portable Windows target does not write `latest.yml`. Packaged portable
runs use notify-and-link delivery (`PORTABLE_EXECUTABLE_FILE`); NSIS keeps
the in-app download and quit-and-install lane. Data stays in the existing
application data directory. Portable requests user execution level, so launch
does not require administrator rights.

RPM targets pass `_build_id_links none` to FPM. Bundled Electron binaries live
under `/opt/PI-Desktop`; omitting global `/usr/lib/.build-id` links prevents
collisions with other applications that bundle the same Electron binaries.

The ASAR asset contains the Electron application archive, not a complete Linux
distribution. To repackage it, place it as the application archive in the
target Electron resources layout together with the native host and other
resources from the target package, then launch it with:

```bash
electron PI-Desktop-<version>-linux-x64.asar
```

Shell smoke on each native runner:

1. Confirm no File/Edit/View/Window/Help menu appears inside the window.
2. Verify F10 and Shift+F10 remain available to focused content.
3. Execute application and editing shortcuts from a focused editor.
4. Minimize, maximize, restore, and close from the custom controls.
5. Relaunch with `PI_DESKTOP_START_MAXIMIZED=1`; confirm the initial
   maximize/restore glyph matches the queried native state.
6. Verify unknown menu/window IPC actions fail with the window open and closed.

## 7. Known limitations

- macOS, Linux deb/rpm, and the Windows portable exe remain notify-and-link
  update modes.
- Linux x64 packages are built on Ubuntu 22.04 so host-core needs glibc 2.35
  or newer (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora 36+). The tag job runs
  `scripts/check-linux-host-glibc.mjs` and refuses a binary that needs a
  newer glibc.
- In-app macOS delivery, rollback, staged rollout, and prerelease channel
  policy remain open release work. GitHub Release macOS artifacts are unsigned
  by default; only a manual `sign_macos: true` run receives Developer ID
  signing, notarization, and stapling before publication.
