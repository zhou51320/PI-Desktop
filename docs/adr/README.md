# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs record decisions that should not silently change.

The [Chinese ADR entry](/zh-CN/adr/) follows the same decision map and points to
these records. Decision IDs, status, and the English record remain the source of
truth for both locales.

## Format

Each ADR includes:

- Status
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Alternatives (optional)
