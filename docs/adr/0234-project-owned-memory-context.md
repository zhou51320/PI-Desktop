# ADR 0234: Keep project memory host-owned and path-scoped

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-12
- Deciders: PI-Desktop maintainers

## Context

Projects need a durable memory surface similar to ChatGPT Projects. Renderer
preferences are not a safe owner for model context: they are presentation state,
can be reset independently, and do not provide a host-enforced boundary when a
session switches projects.

## Decision

Store one user-authored memory collection per canonical project path in the
existing host `kv` table under the `projectMemory` namespace. The visual editor
stores normalized entries with an id, optional title, and content using the
`entries-v1` format. The host also derives a readable plain-text `content`
value, limited to 32 KiB, for runtime injection. Electron main loads the value
for the session-bound project path and passes it to the agent runtime. The
runtime renders it after project instructions as explicitly user-provided
context and compares it when deciding whether an idle runtime can be reused.

The memory editor is exposed from the Project archive row menu. Creating a
project keeps the creation surface compact and shows that project memory is
available later; it does not add a memory mode selector whose semantics the
application does not implement.

## Consequences

- Memory survives renderer restarts and is isolated by canonical project path.
- The visual editor can add, edit, and remove memory entries while the runtime
  consumes the host-derived plain-text projection. Existing legacy records that
  contain only `content` remain readable as one untitled entry.
- Changing memory retires the next reusable runtime so a follow-up prompt sees
  the new value.
- Project memory cannot override runtime safety, tool, or collaboration rules.
- No schema migration is needed because `kv` is the existing extensibility
  boundary for new configuration domains.
- ADR 0249 adds an explicit host-owned logical project-group identity and root
  membership model. Path-scoped records remain the compatibility behavior for
  legacy single-root projects.
